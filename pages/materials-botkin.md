## Responses by Daniel Botkin to Additional Questions

Environment and Public Works Committee Hearing June 18, 2014
Follow-up Questions for Written Submission

To: Senators Barbara Boxer, Chairman, and David Vitter. Rankinq Member.
Environment and Public Works Committee.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify at this Senate hearing. Since the topic of the
hearing, “Climate Change: The Need to Act Now," concerned a scientific topic and the
application of science to policy, and since I was the only professional scientist testifying
at the hearing, and since there was, as a result, a question as to who is a scientific
expert, I would like to add the following information to the record, with the hope that this
will be useful to the Committee in its future consideration of this important question.

I come to you as a scientist, not a politician, not as a member of a specific
political party (I vote as an independent). My doctorate is in biology (Rutgers University
1968) and since 1968 I have done research on the theory of global warming and its
possible ecological effects. I would like to put into the record a list of my scientific
publications that have dealt with many aspects of this topic, as follows:

At the hearing. the statement was made repeatedly by the four EPA
administrators that 97% of scientists agreed that human—caused global warming was
happening I would like to clarify the basis for that assertion and what the facts actually
are as discussed in the paper “Climate Consensus and ‘Misinformation’: A Rejoinder to
Agnotology, Scientific Consensus, and the Teaching and Learning of Climate Change.”[1]
This paper reanalyzes the basis for the statement that 97% of scientists agree that our
addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is causing a major global warming and
concludes “Inspection of a claim by Cook et al. (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of
97.1 % consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3%
endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is
anthropogenic.” it is not 97% of scientists that agree about global warming, but less
than 1%, according to this paper.
