OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES INHOFE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA 

Senator INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for hold-
ing the hearing. 

While I think it is important for us to conduct oversight over the 
ESPS rule, we need to be hearing from Gina McCarthy and Janet 
McCabe and from those who would be affected by the rule which 
includes the utilities, the consumers, the manufacturers, the min-
ers and others. 

We need the record to reflect the whole picture of this rule. We 
need to hear from the experts on electricity reliability like FERC 
and NERC. 

During his time in office, President Obama has pursued a sys-
tematic strategy for using the government to take over major sec-
tors of the economy. He started with Obamacare, nationalizing the 
healthcare system. He went on to Dodd-Frank, making bank bail-
outs a permanent fixture in American society. 

Now we have the first round of global warming regulations which 
would nationalize the electricity market and force Americans to 
live out the President’s green dream. We don’t have to look any fur-
ther to see Obama’s marvel in Germany to see where the path 
leads. 

I think Senator Vitter covered this pretty well. The fact that they 
are now trying to get out from under the mess they are in. Ger-
many’s cost per kilowatt hour has doubled and is now triple what 
it is here in the United States, all because of the course the Presi-
dent has tried to put us on. 

The Administration may claim that this is unlikely because the 
United States has an abundance of cheap, domestic sources of nat-
ural gas. While that is true, I am not naive enough to believe that

the Administration will stop with coal. In fact, Energy Secretary 
Ernest Monis recently said that natural gas power plants will soon 
need carbon capture sequestration technology and saw it on them 
to comply with global warming rules. That would put them out of 
business. 

It is not just coal. It is oil, gas, coal and even nuclear that is 
under attack. Ultimately, President Obama’s electricity takeover 
will force Americans to use less and less electricity at higher and 
higher prices. The motive is clear. 

I am going to ask that this be made a part of the record. Tom 
Steyer is a California billionaire who has promised to pump $100 
million into the elections to help Senate Democrats get elected if 
they make global warming a national issue. 

This isn’t me saying this; this is Tom Steyer. I don’t have $100 
million to give away, he does and this means enough to him. I do 
ask this be made a part of the record. 

Senator SANDERS. Reserving the right to object. 

Senator INHOFE. That is fine. 

Senator SANDERS. I would also like to enter into the record the 
fact that the Koch Brothers representing the fossil fuel industry 
will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on this campaign trying 
to defeat Democrats. 

Senator INHOFE. Do you object to having this a part of the 
record? 

Senator SANDERS. So long as mine is able to be entered, I have 
no objection. 

Senator INHOFE. Sure, you can enter it. That is fine. 

Senator SANDERS. Thank you. 

Senator INHOFE. By the way, I have the greatest respect for Sen-
ator Sanders. We are totally different on our philosophies, I under-
stand that, but we have respect for each other. We have had honest 
debates and this is just one of them. 
I think it is very important that we keep in mind there is a guy 
out there. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. The timer will go back on and both docu-
ments will be admitted into the record.

Koch Brothers Unveil New Strategy at
Big Donor Retreat

The Koch brothers‘ financial network is planning on spending almost
$300 million in the 2014 election. including a new anti-environment
effort.

In the face of expanding energy regulations, stepped-up Democratic attacks and the ongoing fight over Ohamacare, the billionaire Koch brothers and scores of wealthy allies have set an initial 2014 fundraising target of $290 million which should boost GOP candidates and support dozens of conservative groups —-including a new energy initiative with what looks like a deregulatory, pro-consumer spin, The Daily Beast has learned.

This weekend, at a posh California resort near Laguna Beach, energy is expected to be among the topics as Charles and David Koch and their extensive donor network hold a semiannual fundraising and policy seminar. Political allies including Son. Marco Rubio 01' Florida and libertarian political scientist Charles Murray are slated to speak, according to conservatives familiar with the Koch network.

The energy initiative is being created under the umbrella of the largest Koch network nonprofit in apparent response to a number of developments the commitment by liberal billionaire Tom Steyer to steer $100 million into ads in several states to make climate change a priority issue in the elections; numerous setbacks at the state level where Koch network backed advocacy groups have been fighting against.

renewable energy standards; and the new EPA regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.

The meeting will cap a frenetic fundraising season for the conservative donor network. This year the Koch network not only hosted a similar January conference, but several smaller gatherings in Palm Springs, Newport Beach, St. Louis, and other locales to
attract new donors, according to an email from Koch fundraising honcho Kevin
Gentry obtained by The Daily Beast. In his email, Gentry called the Palm Springs event — which drew some 50 wealthy conservatives in March — a “highly successful recruitment reception” and encouraged other veteran donors to get involved by holding local gatherings in their areas Koch network operatives also have held periodic conference calls—sometimes with members of Congress on the line—to update loyal check writers on various issues and keep them in the fold, say conservative sources.

Now, hitting the $290 million goal seems within reach: almost $170 million of that total was pledged at the last big Koch donor seminar in January this year, say two conservative sources The hefty haul will help fund a mix of politically active nonprofits like the Koch backed Americans for Prosperity, and a newer outfit called the Libre Initiative that‘s aimed at appealing to Hispanics with a small government, free—market message. AFP alone is expected to spend upwards of $125 million this year on a variety of political and advocacy projects including air and ground operations, according to Politico.

By comparison, in the 2012 presidential cycle, the Koch donor network raised
more than $400 million to help underwrite 17 politically active nonprofit groups
-including AFP and Libre Initiative — according to The Washington Post.

A few Koch network — backed nonprofit groups including APP have long fought
against climate change regulations, a carbon tax, and subsidies for renewable
energy. But lately, the Koch universe seem to be facing bigger energy threats
stemming from Washington, state governments and big liberal checkbooks.

The new energy initiative is the handiwork of Freedom Partners Chamber of
Commerce, the Koch network‘s central fundraising hub, which was established
in late 2011 as a trade group, according to an email to the group's members
from Gentry. In 2012, the fledgling group — which claims some zoo members
who each kick in at least $100,000 yearly — funneled over $230 million dollars
to numerous other nonprofits in the Koch ecosystem according to the group’s
2012 tax returns.

In an April 1 missive, Gentry invited Freedom Partners members to join an
upcoming conference ml} about a “significant new Freedom Partners initiative”
which he touted as one that would “drive the national narrative around energy

Page 25

The Daily Beast and the tremendous benefits of reliable affordable energy for all Americans, especially for the less fortunate." T he email indicated that discussions about the energy project began last summer at another Koch donor event in New Mexico, which drew outgoing House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Rep. Paul Ryan among others.
Gentry's email stressed that liberal donors, led by hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer have plans to spend as much as $100 million on climate change issues and ads to make it a top-tier issue in the election, He noted that environmental groups had recently run a $5 million "clean energy" ad blitz in Iowa, Michigan, and North Carolina, all of which are considered "focus" states for Freedom Partners and among the states where Americans for Prosperity has spent over $35 million on attack ads against Democratic Senate candidates on Obamacare.
In a chagrined-sounding PS, Gentry opined that the “new multi million dollar campaign by environmentalists is arguably an effort to distract from the failures of Obamacare. But you and I know energy is a critically important issue
for the United States."

The details and scope of the new energy initiative, which has not been announced, aren't clear yet, but it’s expected to cost in the seven figures and be a topic at the Koch donor conference this — especially in light of the Obama administration's newly unveiled EPA regulations to curb carbon emissions from mostly coal fired power plants. Two sources familiar with Koch donor world told The Daily Beast that a new nonprofit group is being formed to help run the new energy initiative, Neither spokesmen for Freedom Partners or Koch Industries responded to requests for comment about the new initiative or fundraising efforts this year.
The Koch brothers combined net worth exceeds 380 billion, according to Forbes magazine, and is derived from their control of Koch Industries, the eponymous energy and manufacturing conglomerate
Based on Gentry’s email and recent energy drives by other Koch network groups, the initiative is likely to mix a minimalist regulatory and free-market message with a pro-consumer spin.

On its website, Freedom Partners explains its energy policy goals very broadly as “increasing access to affordable energy that helps societies-businesses, families and especially the poor—prosper and thrive." It says that the role of federal government is to “administer smart and safe environmental regulations" but argues that too often there's a lack of transparency and that “unsound science" is used to justify decisions Without weighing costs versus benefits

The new energy initiative may partly stem from setbacks in many states where advocacy groups funded by the Koch network like Americans for Prosperity and allies have been waging mostly uphill battles to rollback renewable energy
standards In these fights the conservative nonprofits have often portrayed renewable mandates as very expensive for consumers, a point that‘s frequently been rebutted by independent groups.

Even as Kansas, the home of Koch Industries, the Koch-backed advocacy

Page 26


network failed to repeal the state's renewable standards, which were enacted in 2009 Under Kansas' Renewable Portfolio Standard, 20 percent of the state‘s electricity is supposed to come from renewables by the year 2020.
The Kansas fight suggests part of the strategy that Koch—linked groups are expected to pursue to broaden their message and try to appeal to consumers. Alan Cobb, a former lobbyist for the company who also did stints with AFP and Freedom Partners, was hired this spring by the newly created Kansas Senior Consumer Alliance, which sent thousands of postcards to elderly citizens criticizing the renewable standards. The postcards, with pictures of worried- looking seniors opening their mail, said that there had been 15 rate hikes since 2009 when the renewable standards were enacted and urged seniors to contact their representatives to protest them.
A state commission has found less than 2 percent of recent rate increases can be attributed to the renewable standards.

Groups backed by the Koch network in several other states have also been rebuffed in their drives against renewables, But in late May, in a rare victory, Ohio Governor John Kasich signed off on a two—year freeze on the Buckeye
State's renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements

On the 2014 electoral front, other Koch donor supported nonprofit groups like the American Energy Alliance (AHA) have poured funds into ads targeting Democrats in close Senate and House races, knocking their opposition to building the Keystone XL pipeline. In May, the ABA spent over 8400.000 on ads in Colorado attacking Sen. Mark Udall for his stance opposing the Keystone
pipeline. AEA, which is run by former Koch Industries lobbyist Tom Pyle, has also been fighting to end wind energy subsidies. Last year, Congress ended a two decade old tax credit for wind energy companies after vigorous lobbying by
Koch-backed groups including ABA and AFP. This year the groups have continued to fight against attempts to revive the credit.

The fight over climate change took a personal twist this spring when Tom Steyer challenged the Koch brothers to a debate about the issue and whether more regulations are needed to curb man-made pollution. The Koch brothers turned down the invitation. In an email to a local Kansas paper, Koch spokesperson Melissa Cohlmia explained “we are not experts on climate change."

The Koch seminar this weekend is scheduled to feature a speech by Sen. Marco Rubio (It-FL), who last month sparked a small firestorm when he said that "I don’t believe that “human activity is causing these dramatic changes in our climate the way these scientists are portraying it." Rubio, whose view is contradicted by many scientific studies showing that carbon dioxide emissions
have accelerated global warming, added that he thinks proposed laws to deal with climate change “will only wreck our economy." Rubio's position should get a warm reception among the libertarian leaning donors at the conference

Koch-backed political network, built to shield donors, raised $400 million in 2012 elections

BY MATEA GOLD, January 5

The political network spearheaded by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch has expanded into a far-reaching operation of unrivaled complexity, built around a maze of groups that cloaks its donors, according to an analysis of new tax returns and other documents.

The filings show that the network of politically active nonprofit groups backed by the Kochs and fellow donors in the 2012 elections financially outpaced other independent groups on the right and, on its own, matched the long-established national coalition of labor unions that serves as one of the biggest sources of support for Democrats.

The resources and the breadth of the organization make it singular in American politics: an operation conducted outside the campaign finance system, employing an array of groups aimed at stopping what its financiers view as government overreach. Members of the coalition target different constituencies but together have mounted attacks on the new health-care law, federal spending and environmental regulations.

Key players in the Koch—backed network have already begun engaging in the 2014 midterm elections, hiring new staff members to expand

Page 28

operations and strafing House and Senate Democrats with hard-hitting ads over their support for the Affordable Care Act.

Its funders remain largely unknown; the coalition was carefully constructed with extensive legal barriers to shield its donors.

But they have substantial firepower. Together, the 17 conservative groups that made up the network raised at least $407 million during the 2012 campaign, according to the analysis of tax returns by The Washington Post and the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics.

A labyrinth of tax-exempt groups and limited-liability companies helps mask the sources of the money, much of which went to voter mobilization and television ads attacking President Obama and congressional Democrats, according to tax filings and campaign finance reports.

The coalition’s revenue surpassed that of the Crossroads organizations, a super PAC and nonprofit group co—founded by GOP strategist Karl Rove that together brought in $325 million in the last cycle.

The left has its own financial muscle, of course; unions plowed roughly $400 million into national, state and local elections in 201.2. A network of wealthy liberal donors organized by the group Democracy Alliance mustered about $100 million for progressive groups and super PACs in the last election cycle, according to a source familiar with the totals.

The donor network organized by the Kochs -— along with funding an array of longtime pro-Republican groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and Americans for Tax Reform — distributed money to a coalition of groups that share the brothers’ libertarian, free-market perspective. Each group was charged with a specialized task such as youth outreach, Latino engagement or data crunching.

The system involved roughly a dozen limited-liability companies with cryptic, alphabet-soup names such as SLAH LLC and ORRA LLC, and entities that dissolved and reappeared under different monikers.

Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a University of Notre Dame law School professor who studies the tax issues of politically active nonprofits, said he has never seen a network with a similar design in the tax-exempt world.


Page 29

“It is a very sophisticated and complicated structure,” said Mayer, who examined some of the groups’ tax filings. “It’s designed to make it opaque as to where the money is coming from and where the money is going. No layperson thought this up. It would only be worth it if you were spending the kind of dollars the Koch brothers are, because this was not cheap."

Tracing the ﬂow of the money is particularly challenging because many of the advocacy groups swapped funds back and forth. The tactic not only provides multiple layers of protection for the original donors but also allows the groups to claim they are spending the money on “social welfare" activities to qualify for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status.

Such maneuvers could he sharply restricted under new regulations proposed by the Internal Revenue Service in November.~The- new rules seek to rein in nonprofit groups that have increasingly engaged in elections while avoiding the donor disclosure required of political committees;

The donors

It is unclear how much of the network's funds came directly from the Kochs, who head Koch Industries, one of the largest privately held companies in the country. The brothers, who fund a host of libertarian think tanks and advocacy groups, are heralded on the right and pilloried on the left for their largess.

While “the Koch network " has become a shorthand in political circles, the coalition is financed by a large pool of other conservative donors as well, according to people Who participate in the organization.

Through a corporate spokesman, the Kochs declined to comment on what support they give. “Koch’s involvement in political and public policy activities is at the core of fundamental liberties protected by the first Amendment to the United

Page 30

States Constitution," Koch Industries spokesman Robert Tappan said in an e-mailed statement, ‘This type of activity is undertaken by individual donors and organizations on all ends of the political spectrum -- on the left, the middle, and the right. In many situations, the law does not compel disclosure of donors to various causes and organizations,”

Tappan added that “Koch has been targeted repeatedly in the past by the Administration and its allies because of our real (or, in some cases, perceived) beliefs and activities concerning public policy and political issues."

In a rare in-person interview with Forbes in late 2012, Charles Koch defended the need for venues that allow donors to give money without public disclosure, saying such groups provide protection from the kind of attacks his family and company have weathered,

“We get death threats, threats to blowup our facilities, kill our people. We get Anonymous and other groups trying to crash our IT systems,” he said, referring to the computer-hacking collective. “So long as we‘re in a society like that, where the president attacks us and we get threats from people in Congress, and this is pushed out and becomes part of the culture - that we are evil, so we need to be destroyed, or killed —- then why force people to disclose?"

Since 2003, the Kochs have hosted twice-yearly seminars with like-minded donors at which they collect pledges for groups that share their commitment to deregulation and free markets

Jack Schuler, a Chicago health—care entrepreneur, attended one of the Kochs’ donor meetings in Beaver Creek, Colo, several years ago and has contributed about $100,000 a year to their efforts since then.

“They came across as guys who are putting a lot of their own money into it,”

Page 31

Schuler said. “They are pretty soft-spoken, not screamers or screechers. They provide the leadership, the staff —- without the frameWork, I wouldn’t do it on my own.“

Many donors get involved because they “value the privacy afforded to them by giving to these entities,” said Phil Kerpen, president of American Commitment, a nonprofit free-market advocacy group that is part of the network.

‘There are hundreds and hundreds of very successful and patriotic Americans that take part in the seminars,” Kerpen added.-
anything that goes through any of these entities is Charles and David Koch is very misleading. There are a significant number of donors involved.”

The money

Much of the money that ﬂowed through the network in the last election; cycle originated with two nonprofit groups that served as facto banks, feeding money to groups downstream, according to an analysis by center for Responsive Politics researcher Robert Maguire, who investigates politically active nonprofits.

The biggest was the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, an Arlington County-based group set up in November 2011 that now functions as the major funding arm of the network, according to people-familiar with the operation. The organization, whose board includes current and former Koch Industries officials, brought in nearly $256 million in its first year “significantly more revenue than was expected,”‘according to its tax filing.

Nearly $150 million was in the form of dues paid by more than 200
members of the organization, which is structured as a business league. An additional $105.8 million came from something called “SA Fund."

James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, said the organization

 

Page 32

funds groups “based on whether or not they advance the common business interests of our members in promoting economic opportunity and free-market principles."

Davis said the group has been upfront about its spending and made its tax return available online as soon as it was filed in September.

“Our members are free to disclose their affiliation if they wish," he said. “We leave that decision with them. Unfortunately, recent IRS and other instances of intimidation and harassment of individuals and groups because of their policy beliefs and activities demonstrate why it‘s important to keep such information confidential."

According to people familiar with the network, Freedom Partners took the place of a now-defunct group based in Alexandria called TC4 Trust, which raised more than $66 million in three years before it was shuttered in June 2012, according to tax filings.

The same tax preparer — a Kansas City, Mo. based partner in the accounting firm BKD - did the returns for Freedom Partners and TC4 Trust, as well as for nearly half the other groups in the network and for the nonprofit Charles Koch Institute.

In all, the feeder funds and the groups they financed raised an estimated $407 million in the last election cycle. That figure is a conservative one, since it does not account for the complete revenue of eight groups that have not yet filed their tax returns for the latter half of 2012.

Of the $407 million, $302 million can be traced to Freedom Partners or TC4 Trust.

The sources of the rest of the money remain a mystery, but many donors in the network write checks to the individual groups, according to people

Page 33

familiar with the system. Some of the organizations also have additional funding streams outside the network.

The structure

Freedom Partners and TC4 Trust moved a large share of their funds through an intermediary group, the Phoenix-based Center to Protect Patient Rights, which served as a major cash turnstile for groups on the right during the past two election cycles. It is run by political operative Sean Noble, who served as a Koch consultant in 2012.

Rather than finance CPPR directly, Freedom Partners and TC4 Trust* transferred $129 million to limited-liability companies with changing names that are registered in Delaware, a state that requires corporations to disclose little about their operations: Eleventh Edition (which was renamed Corner Table and then Cactus Wren) and American Commitment (which was SDN, then became Meridian Edition)

Their relationship to CPPR was unknown until May, When the Arizona group acknowledged in amended tax filings that the LLLCS were its affiliates.

Such LLCs are known as “disregarded entities," which means that for IRS purposes. they do not exist. Their revenue is reported o‘n‘the balance sheets of their parent organizations.

Tax experts said disregarded entities are typically used by nonprofits to, for example, hold a piece of real estate to shield an organization from liability. But they also can be used to make it harder to trace the movement of funds
between groups. In its final tax return, TC4 reported doling out nearly $28 million to 10 organizations with names such as POFN LLC, PRDIST LLC and TRGN LLC. Those are the affiliates of the groups Public Notice, Americans for Prosperity and Generation Opportunity, in that order.

Page 34

The Post and the Center for Responsive Politics identified the groups that make up the Koch-backed network through an analysis of tax filings, which revealed their shared DNA. Most have affiliated LLCs and received a substantial share of their revenue from the feeder funds.

The makeup of the coalition was corroborated by people familiar with the structure who said the network is ad hoc and will not necessarily remain constant.

A key player is Americans for Prosperity, the Virginia-based advocacy organization that finances activities across the country and ran an early and relentless television ad assault against Obama during the 2012 campaign. More than $44 million of the $140 million the organization raised in that election cycle came from Koch—linked feeder funds.

Other groups in the network included the American Future Fund, a Des Moines—based nonprofit that poured more than $25 million into ads against Obama and congressional Democrats in 2012; Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian women’s activist group that ran a get out-the-vote effort aimed at young women; the Libre Initiative Trust, a Texas-based group aimed at Latinos; Generation Opportunity, which seeks to engage millennials; and Themis Trust, which houses the data used by
the allied groups.

The network also distributed funds to other independent political players. In the last election, Freedom Partners and CPPR doled out millions of dollars to a wide assortment of groups on the right, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ($3 million), the NRA ($6.6 million), the National Federation of Independent Business ($25 million) and Heritage Action for America ($500,000).

Obama‘s reelection prompted internal reassessments in the network, as it did among many conservative groups that had worked to defeat him in

Page 35

2012. But there are no signs that the coalition plans to retreat. Rather, officials are focused on creating a more effective operation aimed at bolstering the conservative movement for the long term. Freedom Partners, which now has nearly 50 employees, is expected to bring many functions in-house and expand beyond grantmaking, according to people familiar with the plans. Groups such as CPPR are expected to play a smaller role going forward.
Others are already engaged in the 2014 tight. Americans for Prosperity is in the midst of a $20-million—plus ad blitz attacking congressional Democrats for their support of the health-care law, while the Libre Initiative has targeted Latinos with similar messages.
“We raised a lot of money and mobilized an awful lot of people, and we lost, plain and simple,” David Koch told Forbes shortly after Election Day. “We 're going to study what worked, what didn‘t work, and improve our efforts in the future. We’re not going to roll over and play dead.”

Senator INHOFE. Very good. Thank you. 

We have had the global warming parties on the Senate floor and 
all of that is going on but the reason guys like Tom Steyer have 
to go to such lengths to make the political issue is because the 
American people don’t want anything to do with it. 

He talks about polls. Poll after poll show more and more Ameri-
cans learn about the impact of greenhouse gas regulations, the 
more effect it will have on the economy, the less they care. The 
Gallup poll that just came out used to list global warming as No. 
1 and two. You remember that Christine back when you had that 
job. Now it is number 14 out of 15 of the major concerns. The peo-
ple have caught on to this. 

The most important issue is the economy. We know that the pre-
vious version of cap and trade are estimated to cost between $300 
billion to $400 billion a year which amounts to about $3,000 for 
every family that files a Federal tax return. Then we have to keep 
in mind even if this was right, even if they were able to do this 
and pass this, it would not reduce, as one of the members said a 
moment ago, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. 

Lisa Jackson, the Director of EPA appointed by Barack Obama, 
made that statement and said, no, it would not reduce because this 
isn’t where the problem is. It is in China, it is in India, Mexico and 
other places. 

The $3,000 per family would be something that would not 
achieve the benefits that the other side seems to think are there. 
This version is going to have a similar impact. The Chamber of 
Commerce estimated one final construct of the rule would cause 
$51 billion in lost GDP each year. The Heritage Foundation esti-
mated it would decrease household income by $1,200 a year. 
These are the facts but they are not talking about the points we 
hear from the other side. Keep in mind also they are trying to do 
this through regulation, Obama is, because he couldn’t do it 
through legislation. We have had countless bills introduced to do 
the very same thing through legislation. Each time they are intro-
duced, they are defeated by a larger margin. 

I think if for no other reason, the mere fact that it has been re-
jected by the House and the Senate is very significant. Why should 
we through regulation try to do something that the elected mem-
bers of this body have rejected over and over again? 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES INHOFE, U.S. SENATOR 
FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA 

Today we are joined by four former Administrators of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency who were appointed by Republican Presidents: the Honorable William 
Ruckelshaus served as the first EPA Administrator under President Richard Nixon 
and then again under President Ronald Reagan; the Honorable Lee Thomas also 
served under President Reagan; the Honorable William Reilly served under Presi-
dent George H. W. Bush, and the Honorable Christine Todd Whitman served under 
President George W. Bush. 

I am proud that our landmark environmental laws were created with an over-
whelming bipartisan consensus, and it saddens me that protecting the environment 
at the Federal level has become a partisan issue. 
In 1970, the Clean Air Act passed the Senate by a vote of 73–0, passed the House 
by 375–1, and was signed into law by President Nixon.

In 1990, revisions to the Clean Air Act passed the Senate by a vote of 89–11and 
by 401–21 in the House, and were signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. 
But in the last Congress the Republicans then sent us over 90 anti-Clean Air rid-
ers. 

We should all know we must take action to reduce harmful carbon pollution, 
which 97 percent of scientists agree is leading to dangerous climate change that 
threatens our families. To say we can’t have an opinion because we are not sci-
entists makes no sense to me. All the more reason to listen to the scientists. 
The four former EPA Administrators with us today will testify about the need to 
control carbon pollution so we can avoid the most calamitous impacts of climate 
change—such as rising sea levels, dangerous heat waves, and economic disruption. 
The American people understand the threats posed by climate change, and they 
want action. According to a recent Washington Post-ABC poll, a bipartisan majority 
of the American people want Federal limits on carbon pollution. Approximately 70 
percent say the Federal Government should require limits to carbon pollution from 
existing power plants, and 70 percent (57 percent of Republicans, 76 percent of 
Independents, and 79 percent of Democrats) support requiring states to limit the 
amount of carbon pollution within their borders. 

Power plants account for nearly 40 percent of all carbon pollution released into 
the air. Unlike other pollutants, right now there are no limits to the amount of car-
bon pollution that can be released into the air for power plants. 
The President’s carbon pollution reduction plan will avoid up to 6,600 premature 
deaths, 150,000 asthma attacks, 3,300 heart attacks, 2,800 hospital admissions, and 
490,000 missed days at school and work. 

It is in America’s DNA to turn a problem into an opportunity, and that is what 
we have done by being a pioneer in the green technology industry. These new car-
bon pollution standards are no different. Landmark environmental laws have bol-
stered an environmental technology and services sector that employs an estimated 
3.4 million people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And many of these 
jobs, like installing solar roofs and wind turbines cannot be outsourced.
