Re: EPA’s Asserted Authority Under Section 11.1(d) Of The Clean Air Act To
Regulate C02 Emissions From Existing Coal—fired Power Plants

Dear Administrator McCarthy:

On June 2, 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) launched
one of the most far-reaching and expensive regulatory projects in American history: the Carbon
Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units
(“Proposed Rule").] The Proposed Rule seeks to impose limitations on C0; emitted from
existing coal-fired power plants, requiring a staggering 30% reduction in the emissions from
these plants across the country in a more 15 years. West Virginian, a major consumer of coal-
generated electricity and one of the leading producers of coal—-will be uniquely harmed by the
restrictions of the Proposed Rule.

As the chief legal officer for the State of West Virginia, I respectfully request that you
withdraw the Proposed Rule immediately because EPA lacks the legal authority to adopt that
Rule. In the Legal Memorandum for Proposed Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for
Existing Electric Utility Generating Units (“Legal Memorandum” or “Mem,”) that was issued
together with and incorporated by reference into the Proposed Rule,[2] EPA offers only one legal
basis for the Rule: the rarely invoked Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). See 42
U.S.C. § 741 1(d). The problem is that Section 111(d) affirmatively excludes precisely what EPA
is attempting to do in the Proposed Rule.

1 The Rule has not yet been published in the Federal Register and is currently available at
http://wwwz.epa.gov/sites/productioMiles/2014»05/documents/20l40602proposal—cleanpowerplan.pdf.

As this letter explains, EPA lacks authority under the plain text of Section lll(d), as it
appears in the United States Code, to promulgate the Proposed Rule. Section 111(d) expressly
prohibits EPA from regulating “any air pollutant . . . emitted from a[n] [existing] source category
which is regulated under {the national emission regime in Section 112 of the CAA}.” 42
USC. § 7411(d). Given that EPA has imposed extensive and onerous regulations on existing
coal—fired power plants under Section 112, the agency cannot now use Section 111(d) to require
regulation of C02 emissions from those same existing plants. This conclusion is so apparent that
even EPA concedes in its Legal Memorandum that a “literal reading” ofSection 111(d) prohibits
the Proposed Rule. Mom. 26; see also 70 Fed. Reg. 15,994, 16,032 (Mar. 29, 2005) (EPA
making the same admission in a prior rulemaking),

The only textual justification that EPA’s Legal Memorandum offers for departing from
the “literal” terms of Section 111(d) is unpersuasive. The agency relies entirely on a one-
sentence clerical entry in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act that was not codified in the
US. Code but appears in the Statutes at Large. That entry, even EPA has admitted, was clearly a
mistake because it sought to make a technical correction rendered moot by another amendment.
See 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031 (describing the entry as a “drafting error”). Nevertheless, EPA now
claims that it must give meaning to this mistake and, as a result, has announced an interpretation
of Section 111(d) that directly conﬂicts with the language in the US. Code. EPA’s interpretation
rewrites Section 111(d) from a prohibition on the regulation of "any air pollutant . . . emitted
from a source category which is regulated under [Section 1 12],” as stated in the [1.8. Code, to a
more limited prohibition on the regulation of “any hazardous air pollutant” emitted from such a
source category. This sort of reasoning would be wrong under any circumstance, but it is
particularly improper here, where it is being offered as the justification for one of the most costly
regulations in this Nation’s history.

in light of the profound legal infirmities with the Proposed Rule, EPA‘S unprecedented
policy will not survive judicial review. As such, it would be contrary to the public interest to
proceed with publication in the Federal Register. Failure to withdraw the Proposed Rule will
only cause citizens, States, industry, and environmental groups to waste valuable resources
analyzing and commenting on a futile endeavor. Moreover. given the short timeframe for
compliance with the Rule’s objectives, many of these parties will be required to incur significant
and unnecessary costs. This will trigger unwarranted market responses and economic dislocation
from coerced reduction of the use of coal as parties struggle to meet the anticipated requirements.
This is unacceptable. No matter how fervent the desire by some to advance the policies
underlying these regulations, EPA cannon—and should not do so at the expense of the rule of
law.

A. EPA Has Conceded That The Proposed Rule Is Unlawful Under The “Literal”
Terms Of The Clean Air Act

The only authority invoked by EPA for the onerous requirements in the Proposed Rule is
Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, a little-used provision that grants EPA limited power to
require States to regulate air pollutants from existing sources. Mom. 11—12. As it appears in the
US. Code, Section lll(d) requires the EPA Administrator under narrow circumstances to

Page 291

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 3

“prescribe regulations which shall establish a procedure , . . under which each State shall submit
to the Administrator a plan which establishes standards of performance” for certain existing
sources and certain air pollutants. Among other things, the statutory provision specifically
excludes from the Administrator’s authority the power to prescribe regulations relating to
“standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant . . . emitted from a source
category which is regulated under section 7412 of this title 1118., Section 112 of the CAA].” 42
U ,S.C. § 7411(d). EPA admits in its Legal Memorandum for the Proposed Rule that “a literal
reading of that language” means that “EPA c[an] not regulate any air pollutant from a source
category regulated under section 1 12” of the Clean Air Act. Mem. 26 (emphasis added); accord
70 Fed. Reg. at 16,032 (EPA reaching the same conclusion). Simply put, Section 1 11(d)’s plain
text provides that if an existing source category is regulated under Section 112, that source
category may not also be regulated under Section 1 11(d).

The regime codified in Sections 112 and 111 is part of a measured, coherent approach to
regulating air pollutants from new and existing pollution sources. Section 112 01‘ the Clean Air
Act concerns national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants (“HAPs”) emitted from
any number of new and existing sources. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412. Whether a source category is
regulated under Section 112 is generally dependent upon a number of factors. Id §7412(c).
With regard to coal-fired power plants, Congress specially provided that those sources need only
be regulated under Section 112 if the Administrator finds such regulation to be “appropriate and
necessary.” Id. § 7412(n). Section 111(d) in turn addresses the emission of air pollutants emitted
from existing sources not regulated under Section 112. Specifically, when EPA has chosen not
to regulate a source category nationally under Section 112, emissions from existing sources
within that category must be subject instead to state-by-state emission standards under Section
111(d), assuming certain other predicates have been satisfied. The rest of Section 11 l, which is
not at issue here, is not restricted by the scope of Section 112 and concerns national emissions
standards for air pollutants emitted from new sources.

In the present case, it is clear that EPA has no authority under Section 111(d) to regulate
“any” emission from coal—fired power plants, including C02 emissions. EPA categorized coal-
fired power plants as part of a “source category” under Section 112 in 2000, see 65 Fed. Reg.
79,825, 79,826 (Dec. 20, 2000), and the DC. Circuit in 2008 rejected EPA’s attempt to withdraw
that finding, see New Jersey in EPA, 517 F.3d 574 (DC. Cir. 2008). Then, in 2012, EPA
imposed significant Section 112 restrictions on coal-fired power plants. see 77 Fed. Reg. 9,304
(Feb. 16, 2012); 40 C.F.R. Part 63 subpart UUUUU, which the DC. Circuit recently upheld, see
also White Stallion Energy Cm, LLC v. EPA, 1‘ F.3d._, 2014 WL 1420294 (DC. Cir. Apr. 15.
2014). Under the “literal” reading of Section 111(d), Mom. 26, these rules regulating existing
coal-fired power plants under Section 112 prohibit EPA from invoking Section 111(d) to adopt
the Proposed Rule.

B. EPA’s Arguments Based Upon A Clerical “Drafting Error” In The 1990 Clean Air
Act Amendments Cannot Displace The “Literal” Terms Of Section 111(d)

Faced with the unambiguous terms of Section 1 11(d) in the US. Code, EPA falls back in
its Legal Memorandum to an erroneous prior analysis that the agency conducted in 2005, in

Page 292

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 4

which it concluded that Section 111(d) is actually “ambiguous" and therefore subject to the
agency’s “reasonable" interpretation. Mem. 8, 26, That 2005 analysis, which was part of a rule
under Section 111(d) that the DC. Circuit vacated in New Jersey v. EPA, 5i 7 F.3d 574—based
its conclusion entirely upon a clerical entry in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act that
was not codified in the US. Code but appears in the Statutes at Large. According to EPA, the
1990 Amendments included two entries relevant to Section 111(d). Both entries appear in the
Statutes at Large, but only the first amendment—described by EPA as the “substantive” one—w
was incorporated into the (5.8. Code. EPA argues that the mere existence of the second, clerical
amendment creates an ambiguity sufficient to call into doubt the language of Section 111(d) in
the US. Code. EPA’s attempt to displace the plain terms of Section 111(d) was wrong in 2005
and remains so today.

1. The Clerical “Drafting Error” In The 1990 CleanAir Act Amendments Does Not
Create An Ambiguity In The Terms Q/‘Section I 1 Md)

As a threshold matter, EPA’s analysis is wrong because the one-sentence clerical entry
referred to by EPA falls far short of the showing necessary to cast doubt on the plain terms of
Section 111(d) as they appear in the US. Code. The “Code of Laws of the United States current
at any time shall . , . establish prima facie the laws of the United States.” 1 U.S.C. § 204(a). As
“prima facie“ evidence, the language of Section 111(d) in the US Code is displaced only where
the US. Code is “inconsistent” with the Statutes at Large. See Stephan v. United States, 319
US. 423, 426 (1943). There is no inconsistency here.

A review of the two relevant entries in the Statutes at Large reveals that the clerical entry
does not create an ambiguity or inconsistency, but rather is—A-as even EPA has admitted—a
“drafting error [that] should not be considered.” 70 Fed, Reg. at 16,031.

The first relevant entry appears in the Statutes at Large among a list of other entries
making substantive amendments to Section ill. Prior to these amendments in 1990, Section
111(d) had prohibited EPA from requiring state—by-state regulation of any air pollutant on the list
of HAPs published under Section 112(b)(l)(A). This particular amendment made a significant
substantive change by replacing the reference to “112(b)(1)(A)” with the language that now
appears in the US. Code-“emitted from a source category which is regulated under section
llZ." Pub. L. No. 101-549, § 108(g), 104 Stat. 2399, 2467 (1990). As a result, the restriction in
Section 11 l(d) changed from one focused on HAPs regulated under Section H2 to one focused
instead on source categories regulated under that section.

The second relevant entry appears much later in the Statutes at Large among a list of
purely clerical changes — entitled “Conforming Amendments." Pub. L, No. 101-549, §302(a),
104 Stat, 2399, 2474 (1990). As explained in the Senate‘s Legislative Drafting Manual,
"Conforming Amendments” are “amendments of a provision of law that [are] necessitated by
the substantive amendments or provisions of the bill.” Senate Legislative Drafting Manual
§ l26(b)(2)(A). They effectuate the sorts of ministerial changes required to clean up a statute
after it has been substantively amended. Thus, conforming amendments “include[] amendments,

Page 293

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 5

such as amendments to the table of contents, that formerly may have been designated as clerical
amendments." Id

Consistent with its description as a conforming amendment, this particular entry sought
simply to bring up to date the cross-reference in Section 111(d) to Section 1 12(b)(1)(A). Other
amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990 had eliminated Section 112(b)(l)(A) entirely and
replaced it with Sections 112(b)(1), 112(b)(2), and 112(b)(3). This clerical amendment was
designed solely to account for those changes. Specifically, it provided that “Section 111(d)(1) of
the Clean Air Act is amended by striking ‘[l 12](b)(1)(A)’ and inserting in lieu thereof
‘[112](b).’” Pub. L. No. 101-549, § 302(3). Unlike the substantive amendment described above,
this non—substantive amendment would not have changed the restriction in Section 111(d) from
its pre-l990 focus on hazardous air pollutants regulated under Section 1 12.

In light of the substantive amendment, however, the second non-substantive amendment
was clearly an unnecessary mistake or, as EPA has put it, a “drafting error.” When the
conforming amendment is applied after the substantive amendment, as is required by the very
nature of conforming amendments, there is no clerical correction left to make because the cross—
reference to 112(b)(1)(A) has already been removed by the substantive amendment. This is
consistent with the codifier's notation in the US. Code that the clerical amendment "could not be
executed.” Revisor’s Note, 42 U.S.C. § 7411. Where a conforming amendment is entirely
unnecessary, it is rightly understood as a clerical mistake that need not be given any effect, See
Am, Petroleum Inst. v. SEC, 714 F.3d 1329, 1336-37 (DC. Cir. 2013).

EPA has correctly recognized as much—noting in 2005, for example, that the clerical
entry “is a drafting error and therefore should not be considered”~—but it then wrongly
determined that it nevertheless “must attempt to give effect to both the [substantive] and
[clerical] [entries], as they are both part of the current law." 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031; accord
Mem. 21 (recognizing “apparent drafting errors during enactment of the 1990 CAA
Amendments”). This fundamental ﬂaw dooms EPA’s analysis. As the DC. Circuit recently
explained, where a mistake in renumbering a statute and correcting a cross-reference conflicts
with substantive provisions of that statute, the mistake should be considered most likely “the
result of a scrivener’s errorﬂ“ and should not be treated as “creating an ambiguity." Am.
Petroleum, 714 F.3d at 1336-37. Under this reasoning, it is clear that the clerical entry simply
“should not be considered," as EPA originally concluded. 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031. At the very
minimum, the existence of such a non—substantive. “drafting error” is not enough to overcome
the fact that language codified in the U.S. Code is "prima facie” evidence of “the laws of the
United States.” 1 U.S.C. §204(a).

Put another way. EPA now asserts that the non-substantive and substantive
amendments—if each were implemented into Section 111(d)’s prior text standing alone—would
create two separate versions of Section 111(d), Mem. 24. The first version incorporates only the
non-substantive amendment and therefore retains the pro-1990 prohibition on regulating HAPS
under Section 111(d), regardless of whether the source category emitting those HAPs is
regulated under Section 112. The second version is the one that actually appears in the U.S.

Page 294

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 6

Code and substantively changes the prohibition to forbidding EPA from regulating under Section
111(d) any air pollutants emitted by any existing source regulated under Section 112. Mem. 24.

But this approach of treating both amendments as, in effect, creating two different
version of 111(d) directly contradicts EPA’S concession that the inclusion of the non-substantive
entry in the Statutes at Large was merely a clerical “drafting error.” Critically, the only evidence
EPA may use in its attempt to rebut the terms of Section 111(d) as expressed in the U.8. Code is
the Statutes at Large, see Stephan, 319 US. at 426, and the Statutes at Large simply do not
re act two separate versions of Section 111(d). Rather. they reflect only two amendments~one
a substantive change and one a mere clerical entry—~and the clerical entry is rendered moot by
the substantive amendment.[3]

2. EPA ‘5' Policy Arguments Cream No Ambiguity In Section 111(d)

EPA’s policy arguments against the “literal” terms of Section lll(d) also cannot
generate an ambiguity where none exists in the plain statutory text. As a threshold matter, even
if EPA were correct that the “literal" terms of Section 111(d) produce overly harsh results for
EPA’S regulatory authority, EPA may not “redraft a statute in order to avoid what
the agency characterized as the ‘absurd results‘ that would ﬂow from the statute’s language”
where it is, as here, “‘not inconceivable that Congress meant what the statute says?” Ass'n of
Am. RRS. v. Surface Tramp. 8d, 162 F.3d 101, 105 (DC. Cir. 1998) (quoting Mova
Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Shalala. l40 F.3d 1060. 1072 (DC. Cir. 1998)). In any event, EPA’S
policy arguments miss the mark because the “literal” terms of Section 111(d) are part of a
rational regulatory scheme.

This regime quite logically avoids subjecting existing sources to both new national
standards for hazardous pollutants under Section 112 as well as new state-by—state standards
under Section 111, while permitting regulation under both Section 111 and Section 112 of new
sources. Unlike with new sources, the imposition of additional regulatory burdens on existing
sources raises questions of fairness and lost investments, as existing sources that were built under
a different regulatory regime may or may not have the technological or financial ability to come
into compliance with two sets of new rules. Indeed, both Sections 1 12 and l 1 1(d) recognize that
the cost of compliance must be weighed against maximum achievable reductions. See 42 U.S.C.

3 Although some had argued in 2005 and 2008 that the clerical entry should take precedence over the substantive
entry, EPA repeatedly and properly rejected those arguments as having “no merit.“ final Brief of Respondent EPA.
New Jersey v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574 (DC. Cir. 2008), 2007 W1, 2155494. at *103 n.33; accord 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031-
32. For example, the agency has explained that the so-called “last in point of arrangement“ rule of statutory
construction "is inapplicable here, as it applies to discrete sections of the same Act, not competing amendments to
the same section of an Act, as is the case here.” 2007 W1, 2155494, at ‘5103 n.33. Indeed, EPA emphaticallv
declared that it is “hard to conceive“ that Congress would have intended to give effect to the clerical change over the
substantive change, because, among other things, only the substantive change gives meaning to Section
112(n)(l)(A), which was also adopted during the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act. Section 112(n)(l)(A)
required EPA to conduct a study to determine whether coal-fired power plants “should even be regulated under
section 1 12." 70 Fed. Reg. at 15,995. As EPA recognized, this provision is strong evidence that Congress did not
wish to subject such power plants to “duplicative or overlapping regulation." but rather sought to force EPA to
choose between regulating power plants as a source category under Section l12 or 111(d). consistent with the
substantive change and not the clerical one. Id. at 16,031.

Page 295

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 7

§§ 7411(a)(1), 741 1(d), 7412(d). in establishing this regime, under which regulation of existing
sources occurs either under Section 112 or Section 111(d), Congress properly determined that
requiring the same existing source categories to comply with two functionally—independent
regulatory regimes would threaten these sources’ economic viability. Indeed, EPA has recently
imposed costly regulations on coal~fired power plants, which will cost those plants more than $9
billion dollars per year. See EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis for the final Mercury and Air
Toxics Standards at 3-13 (Dec. 2011), available at http://www.epa.gov/mt/ecas/regdata/RIAS
/matsriafinal.pdf‘, EPA’s Proposed Rule would subject those same plants to billions of dollars of
additional costs, through the imposition of duplicative regulatory requirements, forcing many of
those plants to close. That is the exact scenario Congress intended to avoid when it amended
Section 111(d).

in light of this understanding, EPA’s policy arguments in favor of ignoring Section
111(d)’s plain language are insubstantial.

EPA first claims that a “literal reading” of Section 111(d) would be contrary to
“Congress’ desire in the 1990 CAA Amendments to require EPA to regulate more substances.”
Mem. 25-26. But the mere fact that one of the broad purposes behind the 1990 Amendments
was to require EPA to regulate more substances under Section 112 does not mean that Congress
was not cognizant of other values, such as the need to avoid costly double regulation. In fact—
as EPA itself admitted in its 2005 analysis — the text, structure, and history of the 1990
Amendments indicates a desire by Congress to limit EPA’s ability to doubly regulate coal-fired
power plants, As explained above, the discussion and ultimate adoption of Section 112(n)(l)(A)
“reveals” that Congress did not want to subject coal—fired power plants to “duplicative or
otherwise inefficient regulation” 70 Fed. Reg. at 15,999. It is perfectly reasonable to understand
Section 111(d) as seeking to forward this same general goal of avoiding duplicative regulation.

EPA’s other policy argument is “the fact that the EPA has historically regulated non—
HAPs under section 111(d), even where those air pollutants were emitted from a source category
actually regulated under section 112.” Mem. 26. But it is no answer to the unambiguous textual
requirement in the 1990 Amendments to point to EPA‘s pre-amendment practice of regulating
non—l'lAPs under Section 111(0). EPA at one time enjoyed the power of regulating existing
source categories on separate regulatory tracks. See Mcm. 9-10 & n. 17. When Congress
amended the Clean Air Act in 1990 to require EPA to regulate more HAP’s under Section 112,
however, Congress sensibly paired that increased power with a textual limitation—embodied in
Section 111(d}—against using that enhanced authority to impose duplicative regulations on the
same existing source categories. EPA’s argument that the “literal" terms of Section 111(d)
would hamstring it from using a provision that it has only used to regulate “four pollutants from
live source categories” in “forty years," Mem. 9, cannot possibly provide a basis for disregarding
the literal terms of the Clean Air Act.

3. EPA's Attempt To Resolve The Supposed Ambiguity Is Nevertheless
Impermissible

Even if the clerical error created an ambiguity in Section lll(d)’s “literal” text, EPA’s
analysis would still fail. To begin with, the agency’s claim to some unidentified form of
“deference“ for its attempt to rewrite Section lll(d) is meritless. Mem. 12. Courts defer to
agencies under the test set forth in Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc, 467 U .S. 837 (1984), because there is reason to believe that when Congress “left ambiguity
in a statute,” it “understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the
agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion
the ambiguity allows." Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), NA, 517 U .S. 735, 740—741 (1996).
EPA could not possibly argue that Congress intended EPA to resolve the import of Congress’s
inadvertent clerical “drafting error.” Indeed, EPA does not so argue. EPA offers no justification
whatsoever for its bald assertion that it is entitled to deference on this issue, and does not even
cite to Chevron in its discussion of the issue.

In any event, EPA could not possibly prevail under Chevron—fir some other similar form
of deference—because it offers an “impermissible construction” of the supposedly ambiguous
statute. Aid Ass'n for Lutherans v. US. Postal Serra, 321 F.3d 1166, 1178 (DC. Cir. 2003).
EPA would interpret Section 111(d) as follows: "Where a source category is regulated under
section 112, a section 111(d) standard of performance cannot be established to address any HAPS
listed under section 112(1)) that may be entitled from that particular source category.” Mem. 26.
This is flatly inconsistent with the substantive provision, embodied in the US, Code, that EPA
may not “establish“ standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant . . .
emitted from a source category which is regulated under [Section 112 of the CAM.” 42
U.S.C. § 741 Md) (emphasis added). EPA’s proffered interpretation effectively replaces the term
“any air pollutant" with the term “hazardous air pollutant." Even under Chevron, an agency is
not entitled to deference when its interpretation is so “manifestly contrary to the statute.” Mayo
Found. for Med. Educ. & Research v. United States, 131 S. Ct. 704, 711 (2011) (internal
quotations omitted); accord Peril v. US. Dep’t of Educ., 675 F.3d 769, 785 (DC. Cir. 2012).

If EPA wanted to give effect to its view of both the substantive and the clerical entries in
the Statutes at Large—which, as explained above, EPA nonsensically claims create two versions
of Section 111(d}-without impermissibly changing the text of either, it could have done so. As
one commentator has explained, all of EPA’s textual concerns could be satisfied by interpreting
Section 111(d) to prohibit the regulation of “any air pollutant . . . which is not included on a list
published under .. .112(b) [revision of the prior version of Section lll(d) after inputting the
clerical entry] or emitted from a source category which is regulated under section 1 12 [revision
of the prior version of Section 111(d) after inputting the substantive entry].” William J. Haun,
The Clean Air Act as an Obstacle to the Environmental Protection Agency is Anticipated Attempt
to Regulate Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Power Plants, 14 Engage: J. Federalist
Soc’y Prac. Groups 35, 38 (Mar. 2013) (parentheticals revised). EPA does not — and could not——
dispute that this is the only interpretation that gives full effect and meaning to every word of both
“versions" of Section 111(d) that it believes the Statutes at Large embodies. Accordingly. to the
extent EPA continues to reject the position that the non-substantive entry must be discarded as an

Page 297

Page 9

inadvertent “scrivener‘s error[],” see Am. Petroleum, 714 F.3d at 1337, the agency is duty-bound
to adopt this alternative interpretation.

EPA’s refusal to advance or acknowledge this alternative is unsurprising, of course,
because under this approach the Proposed Rule would still be unlawful. Under this alternative
interpretation, EPA would be prohibited from using Section 111(d) both: (1) to require regulation
of any HAP listed in Section 112(b), regardless of whether the HAP is being emitted from a
source regulated under Section 112; and (2) to require regulation of (my pollutant emitted from a
source category that is regulated under Section 112, Even under this alternative reading, EPA
still cannot rely on Section 111(d) as a basis for the Proposed Rule because of the regulatory
scheme established under Section 112.[4]

EPA has fundamentally erred in relying upon the ﬂawed reasoning in the vacated 2005
rule to justify the Proposed Rule. It is simply unconscionable for EPA to go forward with this
massive and costly regulation based entirely upon what it has admitted to be a clerical “drafting

[4] in its prior briefing on this issue EPA cited to Citizens to Save Spencer County v. EPA. 600 F.2d 844 (DC. Cir.
l979), to justify its claim that it is entitled to deference. Final Brief Respondent EPA, New Jersey v. EPA, 517
P.3d 574 (DC. Cir. 2008), 2007 WL 2155494, at * 103, In its Legal Memorandum here, EPA does not cite or rely
upon this case. and with good reason. in Citizens to Save Spencer County. EPA was forced to deal with a situation
where one unquestionably substantive provision specifically conﬂicted with another unquestionably substantive
provision. Faced with this truly irreconcilable conﬂict between two substantive provisions, the DC. Circuit upheld
iiPA‘s adoption of an interpretation that gave “maximum possible effect to both." 600 F.2d at 872. in the present
case, in contrast, the so~called conﬂict is between a substantive amendment and a clerical “drafting error." in which
case the substantive amendment simply prevails. Am. Petroleum, 7M F.3d at 1336-37. In addition, while EPA in
Citizens to Save Spencer County had no option but to adopt a middle ground between two irreconcilable statutory
commands, here EPA has ignored an interpretation that would give "maximum effect“ to its own View of both the
substantive and non-substantive provisions
