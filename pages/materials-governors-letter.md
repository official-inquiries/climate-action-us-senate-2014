Honorable Barack Obama
President of the United States
The White House

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. NW
Washington. DC 20500

Dear Mr. President:

As Governors leading diverse States that both produce and consume energy. we ask that you pursue a
pragmatic energy policy that balances our nation’s economic needs, energy security, and environmental
quality objectives.

As you know, the energy industry is a major source of job creation in our country. providing employment
to millions of our citizens and bolstering U.S. economic competitiveness. America was able to meet
almost 90 percent of its energy needs last year—the most since March l985—in large part because of
increased domestic energy production. We take pride in the fact that domestic production largely powers
America and increasingly other economics as well, helping to eradicate poverty and to provide political
stability around the globe.

Development of our resources has put more money in the pockets of working families and has helped the
poor and elderly on fixed incomes, who can now more easily afford to run their air conditioning in the
heat of the summer. For example. American natural gas production is reducing average retail electricity
prices by 10 percent, saving households, on average, nearly $1,000 per year between 2012 and 2015.

This significant accomplishment of increased U.S. energy independence, with its associated economic
and health benefits. has been achieved largely by State policies—despite redundant and burdensome

Federal regulation. Your proposed rules for regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from existing
power plants and redefining the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) would unnecessarily expand
federal authority over the States in energy policymaking and risk undermining our success.

In an unprecedented move, your GHG emissions plan would largely dictate to the States the type of
electricity generation they could build and operate. In addition, you seek to essentially ban coal from the
U.S. energy mix. Your pursuit of this objective will heavily impact those of our states that rely primarily
on coal for electricity generation—such a decision should not be made by unaccountable bureaucrats.
Your Administration is also pushing for Washington to seize regulatory control of nearly all waters
located in the States by expanding the definition of WOTUS. If successful, the federal government would
become the arbiters of how our citizens, State highway departments, county ﬂood control and storm water
agencies, utilities, irrigation districts, and farmers use their water and their land.

Although we are still examining the impacts of the GHG proposal released on June 2 and the proposed
expansion of WOTUS, we can confidently say that, according to the best available data, millions of jobs
will be lost and billions of dollars will be spent over the coming decades in an effort to comply with these
and other federal regulations. And those numbers stand to increase with every tightening of those
standards — hitting particularly hard working families, poor, and elderly.

Perhaps most disturbing is the fact that your Administration is content to force Americans to bear these
substantial costs where there are highly questionable associated environmental benefits. In fact. your
EPA Administrator admitted during testimony to the U.S. Senate that there would be no climate
mitigation benefits to America pursuing unilateral action. Moreover, in 2008. you personally guaranteed
that under your energy plan, “electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.“ You admitted that your
energy plan would have the following impact: "[Energy industries] would have to retrofit their
operations—that will cost money. They will pass that money onto consumers."

You rightly acknowledge that American citizens will literally pay the price of your energy agenda. They
will also pay the price in the form of lost jobs and less reliable electricity. As representatives of the
citizens who stand to lose so much while gaining next to nothing, it is our duty to confront this issue and
to ask that you rescind the regulations you have put forth. Disposing of these regulations will protect
Americans from the costs and burdens the rules would impose upon them and will ensure the continuation
of America‘s energy renaissance, which is indispensable to our country‘s economic recovery and job
creation and which is largely a result of State policies.

Sincerely,

Governor Sean Parnell 	Governor Mike Pence 	Governor Bobby Jindal
