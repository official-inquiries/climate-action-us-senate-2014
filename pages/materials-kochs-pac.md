Billionaire Koch Brothers Gear Up To Spend Hundreds Of Millions in 2014

It's a been busy month for the billionaire right-wing donors and industrialists Charles
and David Koch. The brothers, along with their Spiderweb of dark money groups, are
actively raising vast sums of money to inﬂuence federal, state, and even local elections
and promote policies that benefit their bottom line at the expense of everyone else.

Here is some of the latest reported news of what the Kochs are up to these day:

* Planning To Spend Nearlv $300 Million On The 2014 Elections. in an exclusive
retreat at a fancy California resort near Laguna Beach last week, the Koch brothers
and wealthy allies unveiled a new strategy for the 2014 elections with an initial
fundraising target of $290 million. The retreat, which featured political allies
including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and libertarian political scientist Charles
Murray, is the most recent of a number of big and small gatherings so far to
appeal to select wealthy conservative donors.


* Starting A New Dedicated Anti-Environment: Effort. As leaders of a vast oil-and-
gas conglomerate, the Koch brothers have a direct financial interest in blocking
regulations to curb carbon pollution. They already fund a multitude of right-wing
anti-environment groups, including the American Energy Alliance, which has
targeted Democrats for potentially supporting a carbon tax. Now, the Kochs are
dedicating a new initiative under their central fundraising network Freedom
Partners that will aim to repeal successful state renewable energy standards and
block the president's proposed regulations to cut carbon emissions from power

Launching A New Super PAC to Send Millions in Direct Support For Right-
Wing Candidates. Previously the Koch brothers mostly funded their 
unprecedented political spending into issue based attack ads slamming
progressive policies. That’s how changing. As reported yesterday, the Koch
network is starting a new Super PAC called Freedom Partners Action Fund that
plans to spend at least $15 million in 2014 supporting right-wing candidates (as
well as attacking progressives, as you might expect).

*Continuing To invest Heavily In_State And Local Policymaking. Americans For
Prosperity, traditionally the Koch brothers’ most active political arm, is ramping up
staff in states across the country to prepare for the 2014 elections and give a more
intense focus toward state and local politics and policy. Paid staff is now at 240 in
32 states, up from 100 in 2010. The group’s president, Tim Phillips, isn‘t shy about
their desire to inﬂuence policy at any level: ”at the state level, I would argue, it's
been a once-in-a-generation moment of free—market policy victories."

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been working to expose the influence
that the Koch brothers have on American politics. In the wake of the recent Supreme
Court decisions striking down contribution limits, he has forcefully pushed for a
constitutional amendment to put limits on campaign spending and called the ﬂood of
dark money like the Koch brothers’ "the greatest threat to our democracy that l have
witnessed during my time in public service."

BOTTOM LINE: The Koch brothers' enormous spending to inﬂuence elections and
policy outcomes is not slowing down at all in 2014. if anything, it is becoming more
expansive, with new organizations joining the network and an increased focus on the
state and local level. The more they spend trying to influence our political system to
protect their bottom lines at the expense of everyone else, the more important it
becomes to expose their goal and work to stop their outsized influence.
