Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you very much, Mr. Thomas. 
Before I go on to the next witness, let me thank each of you for 
your service to our Country in a challenging office over many years 
and for your testimony today. 
We now turn now to Dr. Botkin. 

## STATEMENT OF DANIEL BOTKIN, PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF 
## BIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA BARBARA 

Mr. BOTKIN. Thank, Mr. Chairman. 

I come here today as a scientist who since 1968 has published 
research on the possibility of human-induced global warming and 
its potential human and ecological effects. 

In 1970, I developed a computer model of forest use from then 
to the present to forecast possible climate change effects on forests 
and their endangered species. In the 1980’s, one of my graduate 
students added world vegetation to a major climate model. 

In this new century, I was the lead author on a paper analyzing 
methods to forecast global warming impacts on biodiversity and 
published a paper comparing Arctic sea ice extent in the 19th cen-
tury with that of the end of the 20th century. 

I have spent my career trying to help conserve our environment 
and its great diversity of species, attempting to maintain an objec-
tive, intellectually honest approach in the best tradition of sci-
entific endeavors. 

I have been dismayed and disappointed in recent years that this 
subject has been converted into a political and ideological debate. 
I have colleagues on both sides of the debate and believe we should 
work together as scientists instead of arguing divisively about pre-
conceived, emotionally based positions. 

I was an expert reviewer of both the IPCC and the White House 
National Climate Assessment. I want to State up front that we 
have been living through a warming trend driven by a variety of 
influences. 

However, it is my view that this is not unusual and contrary to 
the characterizations by the two reports, these environmental 
changes are not apocalyptic or irreversible. I hope my testimony 
here will help lead to a calmer, more rational approach to dealing 
with climate change and with other major environmental problems. 
The two reports do not promote the kind of rational discussion 
we should be having. I would like to tell you why. 

My biggest concern is that the IPCC 2014 and White House Cli-
mate Change Assessment Reports present a number of speculative, 
sometimes incomplete conclusions embedded in language that gives 
them more scientific heft than they deserve. The reports are sci-
entific sounding rather than based on clearly settled facts. 
Established facts about the global environment exists less often 
in science than laymen usually thing. The two reports assume and 
argue that the climate warming forecast by the global climate 
model is happening and will continue to happen and grow worse. 
As you can see from Christine’s graph over here, currently these 
predictions are way off the reality. 

The extreme overemphasis on human induced global warming 
has taken our attention away from many environmental issues that 
used to be front and center but have been pretty much ignored in

the 21st Century. By my count, there are ten issues, a number of 
which have been mentioned here today, including global warming. 
A singular focus on climate change as the driver of the other 
nine obscures the best solutions to this full suite of environmental 
challenges we face. In terms of the need to act now, it is on these 
issues that we should focus with the concern over possible global 
warming prioritized properly within that group. 

There is an implicit assumption in both reports that nature is in 
steady State, that all change is negative and undesirable for all 
life, including people. This is the opposite of the reality. The envi-
ronment has always changed. Living things have had to adapt to 
these changes and many require change. 

The report gives the impression that living things are fragile and 
rigid, unable to deal with change. The opposite is the case. Life is 
persistent, adaptable and adjustable. In particular, the IPCC report 
for policymakers repeats the assertion of previous IPCC reports 
that large fractions of species face increased extinction risks. Over-
whelming evidence contradicts this assertion. 

The models making these forecasts use incorrect assumptions 
leading to over estimates of extinction rates. Surprisingly few spe-
cies became extinct during the past 2.5 million years, a period en-
compassing several ice ages and warm periods. 

Some of the reports’ conclusions are the opposite of those given 
in articles cited in defense of those conclusions. The White House 
Climate Change Assessment includes a table of 30 different ecologi-
cal effects resulting from climate change. 

I reviewed the studies cited to support this table and found not 
a single one of the 30 is supported by direct observations. 
The IPCC Terrestrial Ecosystem Report states that 7 of 19 sub-
populations of polar bears are declining in number, citing in sup-
port of this an article by Vongraven and Richardson but these au-
thors State the contrary, that the decline is an illusion. 
On May 22, Vongraven stated that the polar bear population size 
never has been an estimate of total abundance in a scientific sense, 
but simply a qualified guess given to satisfy public demand. 
Some conclusions contradict and are ignorant of the best statis-
tically valid observations. For example, the IPCC Report says that 
terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems have sequestered about a 
quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere by human 
activities in the past three decades. 

I have done the first statistically valid estimates of carbon stor-
age and uptake for any large area of the earth and can tell you 
that estimates of carbon uptake like vegetation used by IPCC are 
not statistically valid and over estimate carbon storage and uptake 
by as much as 300 percent. 

Finally, the IPCC Report uses the term ‘‘climate change’’ with 
two meanings, natural and human induced. I have heard that 
today over and over again. They are not distinguished in the text 
and therefore are confusing. 

Of course the climate is changing. It has always changed and it 
always will change. If the statement is assumed to be about nat-
ural change, then it is a truism, something people have always 
known and experienced. If the meaning is taken to be human 
caused, then the available data do not support the statements.

## Testimony of DANIEL B. BOTKIN
## Before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety
## “Climate Change: The Need to Act Now."
June 18, 2014 at 10:00 A.M.

Since 1968, I have published research on theoretical global warming, its potential ecological
effects, and the implications for people and biodiversity. Some examples: In 1970. I developed the first
computer model of forests used in many versions around the world from then to the present to forecast
possible climate change effects on forests. In the l980s, one of my graduate students added world vegetation
to a major climate model. In 2010. I published a paper comparing century Arctic sea ice extent in the
nineteenth with that at the end of twentieth century. I have a paper in press giving the first statistically valid
estimates of forest carbon sequestering for large areas of the Earth.

I have spent my career trying to help conserve our environment and its great diversity of species.
Some examples: When the Marine Mammal Protection Act was passed in 1973, the Commission asked me to
analyze the law and explain its key concepts both ecologically and legally; I served on a California State
Committee to advise what to do about the then 22 condors remaining in the wild; Under a special bill passed
by the Oregon State Legislature, I directed a five year study of the relative effects of forest practices on
salmon; Under a special bill passed by the California State Legislature. I directed a study concerning Mono
Lake, whose supply of fresh water had been completely diverted to Los Angeles: at the request of the city of
Los Angeles, I wrote a report concerning the use of trees, shrubs and other vegetation in a city in a semi-arid
environment; I have advised the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission: served as the
U. S. representative of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. I have published 14 books
about nature and people including one of the leading environmental science textbooks.

I have always attempted to maintain an objective, intellectually honest, scientific approach in the

Page 137

best tradition of scientific endeavor and have been dismayed and disappointed in recent years that this
subject has been converted into a political and ideological debate, I have colleagues on both sides of the
debate and believe we should work together as scientists instead of arguing divisively about preconceived,
emotionally-based “positions.” I hope my testifying here will help lead to a calmer, more rational approach
to dealing with not only climate change but also other major environmental problems. The IPCC 2014 report
and the White House Climate Change Assessment do not have this kind of rational discussion we should be
having. I would like to tell you why.

The IPCC 2014 report is actually series of reports, each long, complex in organization, and
extensive in scope. The White House Report is 881 pages. Since it’s not possible to discuss these
documents thoroughly in detail today, I will highlight some of my thoughts for you here as they relate to the
reports, hoping to bring a saner, more sober approach to this highly charged issue.

To characterize where we are with these reports and this issue, I would like to quote James R.
Schlesinger, the first US. Energy Secretary, who said: “We have only two modes complacency and
panic. ” — commenting on the country’s approach to energy (1977).

Now to my major points.

i. I want to state up front that we have been living through a warming trend driven by a
variety of influences. However, it is my View that this is not unusual, and contrary to the
characterizations by the IPCC and the National Climate Assessment, these environmental changes
are neither apocalyptic nor irreversible.

2. My biggest concern is that both the reports present a number of speculative, and sometimes
incomplete, conclusions embedded in language that gives them more scientific heft than they
deserve. The reports are "scientific—sounding" rather than based on clearly settled facts or
admitting their lack. Established facts about the global environment exist less often in science

Page 138

them laymen usually think.

3. HAS IT BEEN WARMING? Yes, we have been living through a warming trend, no doubt
about that. The rate of change we are experiencing is also not unprecedented, and the “mystery”
of the warming “plateau” simply indicates the inherent complexity of our global biosphere.
Change is normal; life on Earth is inherently risky. It always has been. The two reports,
however, makes it seem that environmental change is apocalyptic and irreversible. It is not.

4. IS CLIMATE CHANGE VERY UNUSUAL? No, it has always undergone changes.

5. ARE GREENHOUSE GASES INCREASING? Yes, C02 rapidly.

6. IS THERE GOOD SCIENTIfiC RESEARCH ON CLIMATE CHANGE? Yes, a great
deal of it.

7. ARE THERE GOOD SCIENTISTS INVOLVED IN THE IPCC 2014 REPORT? Yes, the
lead author of the Terrestrial (land) Ecosystem Report is Richard Betts, a coauthor of one my
scientific papers about forecasting effects of global warming on biodiversity.

8. ARE THERE SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE STATEMENTS AT PLACES IN THE
REPORT? Yes, there are.

9. What I sought to learn was the overall take-away that the reports leave with a reader. I
regret to say that I was left with the impression that the reports overestimate the danger from
human—induced climate change and do not contribute to our ability to solve major
environmental problems. I am afraid that an “agenda" permeates the reports, an implication
that humans and our activity are necessarily bad and ought to be curtailed.

10. ARE THERE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE REPORTS? Yes, in assumptions, use of
data, and conclusions.

11. My biggest concern about the reports is that they present a number of speculative, and

Page 139

sometimes incomplete, conclusions embedded in language that gives them more scientific heft
than they deserve. The reports, in other words, are "scientific—sounding," rather than clearly settled
and based on indisputable facts. Established facts about the global environment exist less often in
science than laymen usually think.

12. The two reports assume and/or argue that the climate warming: forecast by the global climate
models is happening and will continue to happen and grow worse. Currently these predictions
are way off the reality (figure l). Models, like all scientific theory, have to be tested against real—
world observations. Experts in model validation say that the climate models frequently cited in the
IPCC report are little if any validated. This means that as theory they are fundamentally scientifically
unproven.

Warming Predictions vs. the Real World
<See original document for chart>
 

14. The reports suffer from the use term “climate change” with two meanings: natural and
human-induced. These are both given as definitions in the IPCC report and are not
distinguished in the text and therefore confuse a reader. (The White House Climate Change

Page 140

Assessment uses the term throughout including its title, but never defines it.) There are places in the
reports where only the second meaning—human induced———makes sense, so that meaning has to be
assumed. There are other places where either meaning could be applied.

a. In those places where either meaning can be interpreted, if the statement is assumed to be a
natural change, then it is a truism, a basic characteristic of Earth's environment and
something people have always known and experienced. If the meaning is taken to be
human-caused, then in spite of the assertions in the report, the available data do not support
the statements.

15. Some of the reports’ conclusions are the opposite of those given in articles cited in
defense of these conclusions. For example, the IPCC 2014 Terrestrial Ecosystem Report states
that “there is medium confidence that rapid change in the Arctic is affecting its animals. For
example, seven of 19 subpopulations of the polar bear are declining in number” citing in
support of this an article by Vongraven and Richardson, 2011. That report states the contrary,
that the “‘decline’ is an illusion.

In addition, I have sought the available counts of the l9 subpopulations. of these, only three have
been counted twice; the rest have been counted once. Thus no rate of changes in the populations can
be determined. The first count was done in 1986 for one subpopulation.1

On May 22, Vongraven, a member of the international team that created these estimates, stated
that the polar bear population size, “never has been an estimate of total abundance in a scientific
sense, but simply a qualified guess given to satisfy public demand. . .the range given for total global
population should be viewed with great caution as it cannot be used to assess population trend over
the long term.” The U. S. Marine Mammal Commission, charged with the conservation of this
species, acknowledges “Accurate estimates of the current and historic sizes of polar bear stocks are

Page 141

difficult to obtain for several reasons—the species ‘inaccessible habitat, the movement of bears across
international boundaries, and the costs of conducting surveys.”2

According to Dr. Susan Crockford, “out of the 13 populations for which some kind of data exist,
five populations are now classified by the PBSG [lUCN/SSC Polar Bear Specialist Group] as ‘stable'
(two more than 2009), one is still increasing, and three have been upgraded from ‘declining’ to ‘data
deficient ’. . . . That leaves four that are still considered ‘declining'-two of those judgments are based
primarily on concerns of overhunting, and one is based on a statistically insignificant decline that may
not be valid and is being reassessed (and really Should have been upgraded to ‘data deficient '). That
leaves only one population — Western Hudson Bay - where PBSG biologists tenaciously blame global
warming for all changes to polar bear biology, and even then, the data supporting that conclusion is
still not available. ”3

16. Some conclusions contradict and are ignorant of the best statistically valid
observations. For example, the Terrestrial Ecosystems Report states that “terrestrial and
freshwater ecosystems have sequestered about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted to the
atmosphere by human activities; in the past three decades (high confidence).” I have done
the first statistically valid estimate of carbon storage and uptake for any large area of
Earth’s land, the boreal forests and eastern deciduous forest of North America, and
subtropical forests in Queensland, Australia. The estimates of carbon uptake by vegetation
used by lPCC and in major articles cited by the reports are based on what can best be called
“grab samples," a relatively small number of studies done at a variety of times using a
variety of methods, mainly in old— growth areas. The results reported by IPCC overestimate

Page 142

carbon storage and uptake by as much as 300 percent.

17. The IPCC Report for Policymakers on Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability
repeats the assertion of previous IPCC reports that “large fraction of species” face
“increase extinction risks” (p15). Overwhelming evidence contradicts this assertion.
And it has been clearly shown that models used to make these forecasts, such as
climate envelope models and species—area curve models, make incorrect assumptions that
lead to erroneous conclusions, over—estimating extinction risks. Surprisingly few species
became extinct during the past 2.5 million years, a period encompassing several ice ages and
warm periods.5 Among other sources, this is based on information in the book Climate
Change and Biodiversity edited by Thomas Lovejoy, one of the leaders in the conservation
of biodiversity.6 The major species known to have gone extinct during this period are 40
species of large mammals in North America and Northern Europe. (There is a
“background” extinction rate for eukaryotic species of roughly one species per year.)

18. THE REPORTS GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT LIVING THINGS ARE

FRAGILE AND RIGID, unable to deal with change. The opposite is the case. Life is
persistent, adaptable, and adjustable.

19. STEADY-STATE ASSUMPTION: There is an overall assumption in the IPCC 2014
report and the White House Climate Change Assessment that all change is negative
and undesirable — that it is ecologically and evolutionarily unnatural, bad for
populations, species, ecosystems, for all life on planet Earth, including people. This is
the opposite of the reality. The environment has always changed and is always changing,

Page 143

and living things have had to adapt to these changes. Interestingly, many, if not most,
species that I have worked on or otherwise know about require environmental change.7

20. The IPCC Summary for Policy Makers on Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability
makes repeated use of the term “irreversible” changes. A species: going extinct is
irreversible, but little else about the environment is irreversible. The past confirms this.
Glaciers have come and gone repeatedly. The Northwest Passage of North America has
gone and come again. The average temperature has greatly exceeded the present and
forecasted and has declined only to rise again.

a. Implicit in this repeated use of irreversible is the belief that Earth’s environment is
constant — stable, unchanging — except when subjected to human actions. This is
obviously false from many lines of evidence, including the simple experience of all
people who have lived before the scientific—industrial age and those who live now
and so such work as farm, manage rivers, wildlife and forests.

The extreme over-emphasis on human-induced global warming has taken our
attention away from many environmental issues that used to be front and center but have
been pretty much ignored in the 21st century. By my count there are ten issues, including
global warming. I know it is easier for people to focus on just one issue at a time and ten seems
overwhelming, but they can all be part of, and can be cast in terms of, biodiversity and
sustainability. A singular focus on climate change as the driver of the other nine obscures the best
solutions to the full suite of environmental challenges we face. In terms of “the need to act now” it
is on these issues that we should focus. with the concern with a possible global warming prioritized
properly with that group.


Page 144

Environmental Issues that need our attention now

 

1. Energy
2. Fresh water
3. Habitat destruction
4. Invasive-species control
5. Direct threats to Endangered species
6. Pollution by directly toxic substances
7. fisheries
8. Forests
9. Phosphorus and other essential minerals

The Terrestrial report in a sense acknowledges this, for example by stating: “Climate stresses
occur alongside other anthropogenic influences on ecosystems, including land-use changes,
nonnative species, and pollution. and in many cases will exacerbate these pressures (very
high confidence). "

21. Do the problems with these reports mean that we can or should abandon any concerns
about global warming or abandon any research about it? Certainly not, but we need to
put this issue within an appropriate priority with other major here-and-now
environmental issues that are having immediate effects.

22. I reviewed and provided comments on both the IPCC 2014 report and the draft White House's
National Climatc Change Assessment and, unfortunately, it appears that these issues have not
been addressed in the final assessment. For example in regard to the White House Report, I
stated:

a. "The executive summary is a political statement, not a scientific statement. It is filled
with misstatements contradicted by well—established and well~known scientific papers."

b. "Climate has always affected people and all life on Earth, so it isn't new to say it is
'already affecting the American people} This is just a political statement."

Page 145

c. "it is inappropriate to use short-term changes in weather as an indication one way or
another about persistent climate change."

## WHAT HAS GONE WRONG AND HOW TO fiX IT

1. Rather than focus on key, specific and tractable aspects of climate-change science, the
long-term approach throughout the 20th century was to try to create de nova a
complete model of the climate.

2. This approach has been taken despite a lack of focus on monitoring key variables over
time in statistically and scientifically valid ways, e.g. carbon sequestering by forests;
polar bear population counts. As a result, there is an odd disconnect between theory and
observation. The attempt to create complete models of every aspect of climate has meant
that many factors had to be guessed at, rather than using the best scientific methods. Too
many guesses, too little checking against real, observed effects.

3. Both reports are the result of a very large number of people doing long reviews of the
scientific literature. This easily leads to people being so overburdened that they
misinterpret specific papers, fail to understand where the major observational gaps are,
and have trouble making an accurate list of citations and all sources of information. The
fundamental lPCC and White House Climate Change Assessment approach has been to gather a
huge number of scientists from a large number of disciplines. on the assumption that a kind of
crowd approach to what can be agreed on is the same as true scientific advance While this might
seem a reasonable and effective approach, there is some danger in relying on this “crowdsourced”
model of information sharing. Groups of people, particularly when credentialed “experts“ are involved,
are very prone to a condition called an “information cascade” in which error is compounded by group

Page 146

think, assumptions become unchallenged “fact” and observations play second fiddle to unchallenged
models. The excellent scientists involved with the IPCC reports are no less prone to this than the
excellent scientists who relied on Aristotelian models of a geocentric universe. Entrenched beliefs are
hard to extricate, even amongst supposedly rational thinkers. This is probably in part responsible for
the problems listed with the White House Climate Assessment report’s table of Biological Effects,
discussed later.

4. What a scientist discovers is different from what a scientist says. The first is science,
the second is opinion. Have small groups of scientists work on this problem, no more than
can easily argue with one another, that is less than 20 and preferably even smaller,
representing the primary disciplines. Divide the problem into areas, rather than try to
answer all questions in one analysis. 1 have used this approach in my own work and found
it to be successful.8’ 9

5. The desire to do good has ironically overridden the desire to do the best science.

6. Under the weight of this kind of crowd rule and approach, some specific alternative
approaches to the science of climate change, have not been allowed to rise to the
surface.

7. Among the approaches that would improve climate science:

	1. Return to the former reliance on science done by individuals and small groups with a
	common specific interest and focus.

	2. Change the approach from trying to make a complete, definitive model of every
	aspect of climate to a different level. See kinds of models that explore specific
	possibilities and phenomena.

	3. Get out of the blame game. None of the above suggestions can work as long as

Page 147

global warming remains a moral, political, ideologically dominated topic, with
scientists pushed into, or at least viewed as, being either for or against a single point
of View.

9. We need to focus again on major environmental Issues that need our attention now
(see the list above).

10. ARE THERE EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF RESEARCH I BELIEVE WE NEED
MORE OF? YES.

a. NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS)
b. Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study
c. Whooping Crane monitoring, e.g. of an endangered species
d. In-place monitoring on carbon flux, being done by the USGS in the Great
   Cypress Swamp, florida.
e. Many others.

## COMMENTS ON THE ASSESSMENT

## GENERAL COMMENTS:

The opening statement of the Assessment (p. 1), reproduced here, is characteristic of the entire
Assessment in that it violates one of the basic principles of good climatology ——— never use short—
term weather changes as proof of climate change. Climatologists I have worked with over the
decades have said this repeatedly. In 1962, when I was a graduate student at the University of
Wisconsin working under a science writing fellowship, I spoke with Reed Bryson, said to be the
father of the International Geophysical Year and the person who persuaded Richard Keeling to
begin measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration on Manna Loa, Hawaii. At that time
Earth had been undergoing a global cooling since about 1940. At first Professor Bryson said “if
present trends continue, we are entering a new ice age.” But when I drafted a press release that
quoted him so, he thought about it carefully and told me that we could not make that statement,
because this was just a short— term weather event.

In the 1980s, I worked closely with Climatologist Stephen Schneider and we often gave
talks at the same events. Steve, one of the leaders of the modern concern about a possible
human—induced global warming, also said that you should never use short—term weather events
to infer climate change. I agreed with these experts, and therefore was taken aback by the
overall tone of the new White House Climate Change Assessment, which begins: “Climate
change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present. Corn
producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington State, and maple syrup producers in Vermont
are all observing climate related changes that are outside of recent experience. So, too, are
coastal planners in Florida, water managers in the arid Southwest, city dwellers from Phoenix to
New York, and Native Peoples on tribal lands from Louisiana to Alaska. This National Climate
Assessment concludes that the evidence of human—induced climate change continues to
strengthen and that impacts are increasing across the country.

Based on what my Climatologist colleagues had always told me, the Assessment should have
begun instead by stating: “Corn producers in Iowa, ovster growers in Washington State and
maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing weather-related changes ” outside of their

Page 150

personal recent experience. So, too, are coastal planners in florida, water managers in the arid
Southwest, city dwellers from Phoenix to New York, and Native peoples on tribal lands front
Louisiana to Alaska. “

The Assessment concludes that opening paragraph by stating: This National Climate
Assessment concludes that the evidence of human induced climate change continues to
strengthen and that impacts are increasing across the country.

Americans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter, and
extended periods of unusual heat last longer than any living American has ever experienced.
Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours. People are seeing
changes in the length and severity of seasonal allergies, the plant varieties that thrive in their
gardens, and the kinds of birds they see in any particular month in their neighborhoods (p.1).

These opening paragraphs and several that follow directly communicate to the
reader, both lay and professional, that human-induced global warming in an immediate
disaster. For example:

Other changes are even more dramatic. Residents of some coastal cities see their streets
flood more regularly during storms and high tides. Inland cities near large rivers also
experience more flooding, especially in the Midwest and Northeast. Insurance rates are rising in
some vulnerable locations, and insurance is no longer available in others, Hotter and drier
weather and earlier snowmelt mean that wildfires in the West start earlier in the spring, last
later into the fall, and burn more acreage. In Arctic Alaska, the summer sea ice that once
protected the coasts has receded, and autumn storms now cause more erosion, threatening many
communities with relocation.

Scientists who study climate change confirm that these observations are consistent with
significant changes in Earth ’s climatic trends. Long-term, independent records from weather
stations, satellites, ocean buoys, tide gauges, and many other data sources all confirm that our
nation, like the rest of the world, is warming. Precipitation patterns are changing, sea level is
rising, the oceans are becoming more acidic, and the frequency and intensity of some extreme
weather events are increasing (p. 1).

To be scientifically accurate, these paragraphs should instead have been written (my
changes noted by underlining): Other weather changes are even more dramatic. Residents of
some coastal cities see their streets flood more regularly during storms and high tides. Inland
cities near large rivers also experience more flooding, especially in the Midwest and Northeast.
Insurance rates are rising in some vulnerable locations, and insurance is no longer available in
others. Hotter and drier weather and earlier snowmelt mean that wildfires in the West start
earlier in the spring, last later into the fall, and burn more acreage. In Arctic Alaska, the
summer sea ice that once protected the coasts has receded, and autumn storms now cause more
erosion, threatening many communities with relocation. Scientists who study weather and
climate change point out that short—term, including several decades and longer, changes in
weather do not confirm that these observations are consistent with significant changes in Earth ’s
climatic trends.

These opening statements are directly followed by: Many lines of independent evidence

Page 151

demonstrate that the rapid warming of the past half-century is due primarily to human activities,
The observed warming and other climatic changes are triggering wide-ranging impacts in every
region of our country and throughout our economy. Some of these changes can be beneficial
over the short run, such as a longer growing season in some regions and a longer shipping
season on the Great Lakes. But many more are detrimental, largely because our society and its
infrastructure were designed for the climate that we have had, not the rapidly changing climate
we now have and can expect in the future. In addition, climate change does not occur in
isolation. Rather, it is superimposed on other stresses, which combine to create new challenges
(p. 1), The assertions in this paragraph are based on the forecasts from climate models and
from temperature records. However, figure 1 shows that the climate models greatly
exaggerate the rate and amount of temperature change and are not making forecasts that
come even close to fitting the data. Furthermore, figure 1 also shows that the average
Earth temperature in the past 30 years has changed very little if at all, contradicting the
assertions on the first page of the Assessment.

The Assessment further attributes the supposed climatic warming to human activities
that are releasing greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.
Therefore the claimed disaster is our fault. But recent evidence shows that temperature
change is not tracking the increase in carbon dioxide. The gas has increased from 370 ppm
to just over 400ppm, 8 percent, between year 2000 and year 2014 (figure 2), while the
temperature has changed either only slightly or not at all, depending on how one does the
analysis (figure 3). Instead, temperature change tracks closely changes in the energy output
from the sun (Soon, W. and D. R.  Legates, Solar irradiance modulationofEquator-to-
Pole(Arctic) temperaturegradients:EmpiricaIevidenceforclimate variationonmulti—
decadaltimescales. Journal of Atmospheric and Solar—Terrestrial Physics, 2013. 93: p. 45— 
56.)

Figure 2. Mauna Loa Observatory C02 measurements
<see orignal document for figure>

 
Page 152

figure 3. Earth Surface Temperature Departure from 1950-1980 Average

The current evidence from scientific observations shows that Earth’s temperature has not
changed very much, if at all, since the start of the new century, while carbon dioxide has
increased considerably.

Given these facts, the basic opening assertions of the new U.S. Climate Change
Assessment are about a hypothetical world, not a real world, and must be taken as a “what
it” rather than “what is". Therefore the dire consequences forecast in the Assessment
cannot be taken as reliable, nullifying many, if not most, of the ecological and biological
implications the Assessment makes heavy use of.

The time available to write and the space available to publish as written testimony
prevent a comprehensive, detailed review of the entire White House Climate Change
Assessment. As a result, I have used as an example of the kinds of problems throughout the
Assessment the table appearing on pages 204—5, Biological Responses To climate Change. As an
ecologist, l have taken that table and reorganized it. This reorganization follows.

Although the document is titled “Climate Change Assessment,” the term “climate
change” is not defined and is in fact used with two meanings, natural and human-induced. There
are places in the Assessment where only the second meaning makes sense, so that meaning has
to be assumed. There are other places where either meaning could be applied. In those places
where either meaning can be interpreted, if the statement is assumed to be a natural change, then
it is a truism, a basic characteristic of Earth’s environment and something people have always
known and experienced. If the meaning is taken to be human—caused, then in spite of the
assertions in the Assessment, the available data do not support the statements.

For example, the Assessment‘s section titled CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE begins with the statement: Climate change, once considered an issue for a
distant future, has moved firmly into the present. Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in

Page 153

Washington State, and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related
changes that are outside of recent experience.

If this is to be interpreted as natural, then people have frequently in history experienced
“climate-related changes that are outside of [their] recent experiences," as the Medieval

Warming and Little Ice Age demonstrate,(2,3,4) and therefore it is not unusual nor unexpected
in ordinary life. If this is to be interpreted to be human-induced, then the evidence just discussed
demonstrates that this kind of change cannot be attributed to human actions and therefore the
statement is false.

ANALYSIS OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ASSESSMENT TABLE OF
ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS, titled Biological responses to climate change
(Assessment’s pages 204-205)

The Assessment presents a list of 30 biological responses to climate change. Since this is my
particular area of expertise, I have analyzed this list and sorted the items into the following
categories: Where the Assessment is wrong based on my understanding (10 items);
Improvements (12 items); Declines (which can be taken as worsening) (No items); Predicted
from Climate Models, Therefore Not Fact, especially given the failure of climate models to
forecast with any reliability Earth’s increase in temperature since the 1990s (see figure 1) (3
items); and Unlikely or Unsupported Statement (5 items). Within the context of the
Assessment, this table comes across as meaning to demonstrate more very negative effects
of a human-induced global warming, but since upon analysis none of the 30 appears to be
a legitimately supported decline that might occur under a hypothetical global warming or
have been directly observed, this table in fact is an argument against the overall message of
the Assessment.

(The number that appears at the beginning of each entry is the number in the Assessment's list.
The numbers following each of the Assessment’s entry are the citation number as listed in the
Assessment. The Assessment‘s statements are in italics; my comments appear in plain font.)

## ASSESSMENT IS WRONG

1. 21. Seedling survival of nearly 20 resident and migrant tree species decreased during
years of lower rainfall in the Southern Appalachians and the Piedmont areas, indicating
that reductions in native species and limited replacement by invading species were likely
under climate change. 134 Since the climate models are admittedly weak about changes
in rainfall, this statement has no relevance to purported human—induced global warming.

2. 27. Water temperature data and observations of migration behaviors over a 34-year time
Period showed that adult pink salmon migrated earlier into Alaskan Creeks, and fry
advanced the tinting of migration out to sea. Shifts in migration timing may increase the
potential for a mismatch in optimal environmental conditions for early life stages, and
continued warming trends will likely increase pre-spawning mortality and egg mortality
rates.87 Salmon have evolved and are adapted to environmental change.

3. 3. Conifers in many western forests have experienced mortality rates of up to 87% from
warming-induced changes in the prevalence of pests and pathogens and stress from
drought.118 Important causes of the mortality of trees in western forests are: fire
suppression, which promotes insect and disease outbreaks, and from introduced

Page 154

(invasive) insects and diseases.

4. 8. Warmer and drier conditions during the early growing season in high-elevation
habitats in Colorado are disrupting the timing of various flowering patterns, with
potential impacts on many important plant—pollinator relationships. 77 “Disrupting " is
a politically loaded term. The scientific term would be “changed” and this is a good
sign, showing the adaptability of species to changing environments.

5. 12. Variation in the timing and magnitude of precipitation due to climate change was
found to decrease the nutritional quality of grasses, and consequently reduce weight gain
of bison in the Konza Prairie in Kansas and the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in
Oklahoma] 24, Results provide insight into how climate change will affect grazer
population dynamics in the future. This is stated in a way that is not open to scientific
evaluation. No doubt lower rainfall has negative effects, but the statement is “variation.”

In fact, the publication cited (Craine et al., 2008)5 states that “Greater late summer
precipitation increased bison weight gain . . . “greater midsummer precipitation decreased
weight gain.” This is a scientifically interesting result for those focused on wildlife in
grasslands, but it is neither a negative nor positive in terms of global warming, because
the forecasting models are weakest in forecasting rainfall even annually, let alone
seasonally. Therefore these results cannot be taken as negative (nor positive) effects of a
global rise in average temperature.

6. 10. Cutthroat trout populations in the western US. are projected to decline by up to
58%, and total trout habitat in the same region is projected to decline by 47%, due to
increasing temperatures, seasonal shifts in precipitation, and negative interactions with
nonnative species. 8. Stresses on Cutthroat extend considerably beyond Climate change
and have to do with fishing intensity, water diversions and other habitat changes, such as
competition from introduced, invasive species such as lake trout and rainbow trout.6

7. 28. Warmer springs in Alaska have caused earlier onset of plant emergence, and
decreased spatial variation in growth and availability of forage to breeding caribou. This
ultimately reduced calving success in caribou populations.138 The implication is that
warming will necessarily have a negative effect on caribou, but the paper cited (Post ct
al., 2008) actually is much more cautious, stating “it is highly relevant to herbivore.
ecology to consider the manner in which warming will alter spatial patterns of plant
phenology at more immediate spatial scales than that of the regional landscape. The
paper concludes, cautiously: “ Large herbivores prefer newly emergent forage,
presumably owing to the high digestibility and nutrient content of young plant tissues . . .
future warming could conceivably impair the ability of herbivores such as caribou to
forage selectively, with adverse consequences for their productivity. We suggest,
therefore, that it is highly relevant to herbivore ecology to consider the manner in which
warming will alter spatial patterns of plant phenology at more immediate spatial scales
than that of the regional landscape.”7

There is again an inherent assumption that a steady-state between living things
and climate is natural and necessary for a species’ persistent. Wildlife population can
and do adjust to changes, but this can take some time. See the examples of current
adjustments, which i have added below this table. Give the populations at little time to
adjust.

Page 155

8. 26 Changes in female polar bear reproductive success (decreased litter mass and
numbers of yearlings) along the north Alaska coast have been linked to changes in body
size and/or body condition following years with lower (availability of optimal sea ice
habitat. 137. There is evidence that polar bears are adjusting by feeding more on
terrestrial prey. Contrary to the publicity about polar bears, there is little information
demonstrating any statistically, scientifically valid decline in polar bear populations, 1
have sought the available counts of the 19 subpopulations. Of these, only three have been
counted twice; the rest have been counted once. Thus no rate of change in the population
is possible. The first count was done 1986 for one subpopulation.8

9. 7. Quaking aspen—dominated systems are experiencing declines in the western US, after
stress due to climate induced drought conditions during the last decade, 122 Anderegg,
W. R. L., J. M. Kane, and L. D. Li Anderegg, 2012: Consequences of widespread tree
mortality triggered by drought and temperature stress. Nature Climate Change, 3, 30-36,
doi:10.1038/nclimate1635. Given the failure of the climate models to predict
temperature change and the observed lack of a significant recent rise in temperature, it is
incorrect to refer to this as a “climate induced’ drought. Moreover, a thousand year tree—
ring study shows that deep droughts are characteristic of California. Meteorologist
Martin P. Hoerling wrote on March 8, 2014 that “At present, the scientific evidence does
not support an argument that the drought there is appreciably linked to human—induced
Climate change.” Hoerling is a research meteorologist, specializing in climate dynamics,
at the Earth System Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the White House's National Climate Assessment cites many of
Hoerling’s papers, including figure 20.4 “Longer Frost-free Season Increases Stress on
Crops,” so his work is respected by the authors.

10. 9. Population fragmentation of wolverines in the northern Cascades and Rocky
Mountains is expected to increase as spring snow cover retreats overt/1c coming

centuryJZ3 The paper cited, Dawson et al. (20l l)9, does not mention wolverines. And
contrary to making a highly negative statement, the paper states Populations of many
species have persisted in situ at individual sites since the last glacial maximum
(toleration) and many have undergone habitat shifts, moving short distances (1 to 10 km)
to sites with different aspects, slopes, elevations. and other attributes as the environment
changed. Migrations of100 to 1000 km are well documented for many species

## IMPROVEMENTS

1. 2. Northern flickers arrived at breeding sites earlier in the Northwest in response to
temperature changes along migration routes, and egg laying advanced by 1.15 days for
every degree increase in temperature, demonstrating that this species has the capacity to
adjust their phenology in response to climate change] I 7

2. 11.Comparisons of historical and recent first flowering dates for 178 plant species from
North Dakota showed significant shifts occurred in over 40% of species examined, with
the greatest changes observed during the two warmest years of the study. 75

3. 14. Migratory birds monitored in Minnesota over a 40-year period showed significantly
earlier arrival dates, particularly in short-distance migrants, indicating that some
species are capable of responding to increasing winter temperatures better than


Page 156

others. 

4. 15. Up to 50% turnover in amphibian species is projected in the eastern US. by 2100,
including the northern leopard frog, which is projected to experience poleward and
elevational range shifts in response to climatic changes in the latter quarter of the
century. 127

5. 16. Studies of black ratsnake (Elaphe obsoleta) populations at different latitudes in
Canada, Illinois, and Texas suggest that snake populations, particularly in the northern
part of their range. could benefit from rising temperatures if there are no negative
impacts on their habitat and prey. 128

6. 17. Warming-induced hybridization was detected between southern and northern flying
squirrels in the Great Lakes region of Ontario, Canada, and in Pennsylvania after a
series of warm winters created more overlap in their habitat ran ge, potentially acting to
increase population persistence under climate change.129

7. 18. Some warm—water fishes have moved northwards, and some tropical and subtropical
fishes in the northern Gulf ofMexico have increased in temperate ocean habitat. 130
Similar shifts and invasions have been documented in Long Island Sound and
Narragansett Bay in the Atlantic.131

8. 23. Over the last 130 years (1880—2010), native bees have advanced their spring arrival
in the northeastern US. by an average of 10 days, primarily due to increased warming.
Plants have also showed a trend of earlier blooming, thus helping preserve the synchrony
in timing between plants and pollinators. 135

9. 24. In the Northwest Atlantic, 24 out of 36 commercially exploited fish stocks showed
significant range (latitudinal and depth) shifts between 1968 and 2007 in response to
increased sea surface and bottom temperatures.55

10. 25. Increases in maximum, and decreases in the mutual variability of} sea surface
temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean have promoted growth of small phytoplankton
and led to a reorganization in the species composition of primary (phytoplankton) and
secondary (zooplankton) producers. 136

11. 29. Many Hawaiian mountain vegetation types were found to vary in their sensitivity to
changes in moisture availability; consequently. climate change will likely influence
elevation-related vegetation patterns in this region.139

12. 5. In response to climate-related habitat change, many small mammal species have
altered their elevation ranges, with lower-elevation species expanding their ranges and
higher»elevation species contracting their ranges. 120

## DECLINES

None.

## PREDICTED FROM CLIMATE MODELS, THEREFORE NOT FACT

1. 30. Sea level is predicted to rise by 1.6 to 3.3 feet in Hawaiian waters by 2100. consistent
with global projections of l to 4 feet of sea level rise (sec Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate.
Key Message 10). This is projected to increase wave heights, the duration of turbidity,
and the amount of re-suspended sediment in the water; consequently, this will create
potentially stressful conditions for coral reef communities. 140

2. 6. Northern spotted owl populations in Arizona and New Mexico are projected to decline

Page 157

during the next century and are at high risk for extinction due to hotter. drier conditions,
while the southern California population is not projected to be sensitive to future climatic
changes. 121

3. 19. Global marine mammal diversity is projected to decline at lower latitudes and
increase at higher latitudes due to changes in temperatures and sea ice, with complete
loss of optimal habitat for as many as 1 1 species by midcentury; seal populations living
in tropical and temperate waters are particularly at risk to future declines.132

## UNLIKELY CORRELATION 0R UNSUPPORTED STATEMENT

1. 13. (a and b) Climatic fluctuations were found to influence mate selection and increase
the probability of infidelity in birds that are normally socially monogamous, increasing
the gene exchange and the likelihood of offspring survival. 125

2. 20. Higher nighttime temperatures and cumulative seasonal rainfalls were correlated with
changes in the arrival times of amphibians to wetland breeding sites in South Carolina
over a 30-year time period (1978~2008). 133 Of course. The time period precedes any
possible effect of human-induced global warming, and the effect is a truism. Rainfall
will affect amphibians. Since the climate models are admittedly weak about changes in
rainfall, this statement has no relevance to purported human—induced global warming.

3. 22. Widespread declines in body size of resident and migrant birds at a bird-banding
station in western Pennsylvania were documented over a 40-year period; body sizes of
breeding adults were negatively correlated with mean regional temperatures from the
preceding year.85 The citation for this statement is NatureServe, cited 2012: Ecosystem-
based Management Tools Network. [Available online at www.cbmtools.org i. This is a
general website. 1 used its search option and did not find bird-banding nor Pennsylvania,
nor any reference to a study of bird-banding in Pennsylvania.

4. 4. Butterflies that have adapted to specific oak species have not been able to colonize
new tree species when climate change-induced tree migration changes local forest types,
potentially hindering adaptation. 119 . The citation 119 in the Assessment is Aumen, N.,
L. Berry, R. Best. A. Edwards, K. Havens, J. Obcysekera, D. Rudnick, and M. Scerbo.

[Available online at

http://www.ces.fatt.edu/climate change/ecology-february—ZO13/PECFEFCS_Report.pdfl.
I searched this report and found no mention of butterflies. This is probably an
inadvertent editing error and the authors of the Assessment meant to refer to some other
paper, but since this is the actual listing, the statement is unsupported.

5. 1. Mussel and barnacle beds have declined or disappeared along ports of the Northwest
coast due to higher temperatures and drier conditions that have compressed habitable
intertidal space] I 6. The citation listed is Burke, L., L. Reytar, M. Spalding, and A.
Perry. 201 1: Reefs at Risk Revisited. World Resources Institute, 130 pp. [Available
online at httn://pdf.wri.ora/rcefs at risk revisited.pdf]. I searched this citation and did
not find any mention of the words mussel or barnacle and the only mention of
“northwest” was “northwestern Hawaii.” Again this is likely a typographic error, but no
other statement in the Assessment brought me to a relevant paper either, so the statement

Page 158

is unsupported by the report.

SOME OTHER EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC STATEMENTS THAT ARE INCORRECT,
OR OVERSTATED, OR LIMITED TO A FEW SPECIfiC CASES, OR OTHERWISE OF
DOUBTFUL GENERALITY

Given the length of the just-released White House Climate Change Assessment and the
time available to review it, I am able to consider only a few examples of other specific
problems with the Assessment. I have focused on those that have to do with biological
factors. These, however, are representative of problems throughout the Assessment. (Once
again, the material in italics is quotes from the Assessment; the material in standard font is my
text.)

Cores from corals, ocean sediments, ice records, and other indirect temperature measurements
indicate the recent rapid increase of ocean temperature is the greatest that has occurred in at
least the past millennium and can only be reproduced by climate models with the inclusion of
human-caused sources of heat—trapping gas emissions (p. 559). As we saw earlier, the climate
models are not coming even close to forecasting air temperature change, and therefore could not
be expected to forecast accurately changes in ocean temperature, so it is not correct to say that
something "can only be reproduced by climate models with the inclusion of human-caused
sources of heat-trapping gas emissions."

Warmer air and ocean temperatures are also causing the continued, dramatic decline in Arctic
sea ice during the summer (panel D) (p. 560). We published a paper comparing Arctic sea ice
extent in the nineteenth century, using historical records from ships hunting the bowhead whale,
with those in recent times.[10] In this paper we wrote, “Records from May indicate that
end—of—winter sea-ice extent in the Bering Sea during the mid-l9th century closely resembled
that in the 1972—82 data. However, the historical data reveal that sea ice was more extensive
during summer, with the greatest difference occurring in July. This pattern indicates a later and
more rapid seasonal retreat.” While the statement in the White House Climate Change
Assessment is not contradicted by our paper, the limited statement (about the summer) in the
Assessment once again paints a dire picture to the average reader, whereas our work suggests
that in fact the sea ice extent recovered over winter, and changes in arctic sea ice are more
complicated than the Assessment implies. The problem here is a matter of tone and
communication.

Key Message 4: Seasonal Patterns: Timing of critical biological events»-——such as spring bud
burst, emergence from overwintering, and the start of migrations—41m shifted, leading to
important impacts on species and habitats (p.201). The implication here is that this is entirely
negative for life on Earth and will forever be so. But on the contrary, the environment has always
changed and is always changing, and living things have had to adapt to these changes.
interestingly, many, if not most, species that I have worked on or otherwise know about require
environmental change, including salmon and sequoia trees.[11,12]

Page 159

Two of the longest studies of animals and plants in Great Britain show that at least some
species are adjusting to recent weather changes in “timing of critical biological events, such as
spring bud burst, emergence from overwintering.” For example, a 47-year study of the bird
Pants major (one of the longest monitoring of any bird species) shows that these birds are
responding behaviorally to recent weather changes. A species of caterpillar that is one of the
main foods of this bird during egg-laying has been emerging earlier as spring temperatures have
risen. In response, females of this bird species are laying their eggs an average of two weeks 
earlier.[13]

The second study, one of the longest experiments about how vegetation responds to
temperature and rainfall, shows that long-lived small grasses and sedges are highly resistant to
climate change. The authors of the study report that changes in temperature and rainfall during
the past 13 years “have had little effect on vegetation structure and physiognomy.”[14]

Of course with any environmental change, not all species will do well. This has always
been the case, and is consistent with Darwinian evolution and with ecological knowledge. Black
guillemots (Cepphus grylle), birds that nest on Cooper Island, Alaska, illustrate that some
species are having difficulties adjusting to climate change. (However, black guillemots in their
entire range are not a threatened or endangered species. It is only their abundance on Cooper
Island that has declined.)

The problem has been that temperature increases in the 1990s caused the sea ice to
recede farther from the island each spring, The parent birds feed on Arctic cod found under the
sea ice and must then return to the nest to feed their chicks, who are not yet mature enough to
survive on their own. For the parents to do this, the distance from feeding grounds to nest must
be less than about 30 km, but in recent years the ice in the spring has been receding as much as
500—800 km (300—500 mi) from the island. As a result, the black guillemots on the island have
lost an important source of food. The birds have sometimes targeted sculpin, which is not as
abundant as cod.15

But the real problem these Cooper Island birds face today is egg predation by polar bears.
With less sea ice during this time period, bears have gone ashore and eaten young birds. In 2009,
of the 180 guillemots that hatched, only one on the island fledged (flew away).The solution to
this has been to build bear—proof nesting boxes for the birds. In 2O1O, bear proof nesting boxes
resulted in about 100 birds that fledged.

Two points emerge here. One is that living things do in fact often adjust to changes in
the timing of climate events; if not, there would be little or no life on Earth. The second is that
the real problem black guillemots face is here—and-now predation, which can be and has been
dealt with and does not require a single focus on whether or not the climate change was human—
induced.

Chapter 7, Forests, opens with this:

Key Messages

1. Climate change is increasing the vulnerability of many forests to ecosystem changes and tree
mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought, and disease outbreaks.

As I noted before, the Assessment suffers from the use of the term “climate change” with two
meanings: natural and human—induced. The implication in this key message is that the forest
problems are the result of human-induced climate change, but as I have made clear, both the

Page 160

failure of the models and the failure of temperature change to closely track C02 make this key
statement false. Furthermore, it is well known that (1) forest wildfires are largely due to long-
term suppression of fires in the twentieth century, which allowed the buildup of excessive fuel;
and (2) that insect infestations and disease outbreaks are heavily the result of introduced species
and the failure to remove dead and decaying timber from forests. In addition, this key statement
is another example where recent weather patterns are said to represent and prove human—induced
global warming. which I pointed out at the beginning is incorrect.

Key Message 2. U. S. forests and associated wood products currently absorb and store the
equivalent of about 16% of all carbon dioxide (C02) emitted by fossil fuel burning in the US.
each year. Climate change, combined with current societal trends in land use and forest
management, is projected to reduce this rate of forest C02 uptake.

As explained in my review of the IPCC 2014 report, the estimates of carbon uptake by
vegetation used by IPCC and in major articles cited by the reports are based on what can best be
called “grab samples,” a relatively small number of studies done at a variety of times using a
variety of methods, mainly in old-growth areas. The results reported by IPCC overestimate
carbon storage and uptake by as much as 300%. 16 Therefore this is an unreliable statement.

As I stated at above, these are representative examples of problems that exist throughout the
Climate Change Assessment.

## Responses by Daniel Botkin to Additional Questions

Environment and Public Works Committee Hearing June 18, 2014
Follow-up Questions for Written Submission

To: Senators Barbara Boxer, Chairman, and David Vitter. Rankinq Member.
Environment and Public Works Committee.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify at this Senate hearing. Since the topic of the
hearing, “Climate Change: The Need to Act Now," concerned a scientific topic and the
application of science to policy, and since I was the only professional scientist testifying
at the hearing, and since there was, as a result, a question as to who is a scientific
expert, I would like to add the following information to the record, with the hope that this
will be useful to the Committee in its future consideration of this important question.

I come to you as a scientist, not a politician, not as a member of a specific
political party (I vote as an independent). My doctorate is in biology (Rutgers University
1968) and since 1968 I have done research on the theory of global warming and its
possible ecological effects. I would like to put into the record a list of my scientific
publications that have dealt with many aspects of this topic, as follows:

## Questions for Botkin Questions from: Senator David Vitter

1.

Will the Existing Source Performance Standard rule as currently
constructed have a measurable effect on global average temperatures, sea level
rise, the extent of sea ice, or the severity or frequency of hurricanes, tornados,

Page 169

droughts, or floods?

If the United States acts alone, the scientific estimates I have read indicate that
this will have very little effect on the average temperature and therefore on these other
factors if the rest of the nations of the world continue to emit as much carbon dioxide as
they are at present and as forecast they will release in the future. More important, as I
show in my testimony, the forecasts from the global climate models do not correspond
at all to recent and current temperature trends, but instead vastly overestimate the
changes. If this lack of correlation continues, then temperatures will not increase at
anywhere near the rate forecast by the climate models from greenhouse gases, and
therefore will this reduction by the US. would have little effect on the climate.

2. Dr. Botkin, you served as an expert reviewer for both the recent IPCC
report as well as the White House Climate Assessment. Did you find either
process responsive to reviewer comments?

No, to my knowledge neither process was responsive to any of my comments as
a reviewer.

## Questions from: Senator Jeff Sessions

1. Your testimony did an excellent job of highlighting the risks of reliance
upon the IPCC 2014 Assessment and the National Climate Change Assessment
for major policy decisions.

The four EPA Administrators who testified at the hearing wrote an op-ed last
year that says "There is no longer any credible scientific debate about the basic
facts" and “delay could mean that warming becomes ‘locked in!" Do you believe
that there is still scientific debate about the extent to which human greenhouse
gas emissions affect the climate? And how do you respond to the claim that
"delay could mean that warming becomes ‘locked in?”

Regarding whether there is a scientific debate: Yes, there is still a legitimate
scientific debate about the extent to which greenhouse gas emissions are affecting
Earth’s climate. It is well known that carbon dioxide, methane, and some other gases
absorb specific wavelengths of infrared light, which is informally known as heat
radiation, and therefore function as “greenhouse gases," the term usually used
informally. On a planet like Mars or Venus, without life, without water in its three phases
— gas, liquid, and solid —— and without plate tectonics, and with an atmosphere
composed largely of carbon dioxide, this gas has a major effect on that planet’s climate.
But on Earth the situation is much more complicated, because water vapor is the
primary greenhouse gas, because water is continually passing from vapor to condensed
(liquid) water in the atmosphere in ways that are extremely complex, passing from liquid
to ice and back again in the oceans and on the land also in extremely complex patterns,
and because life on Earth affects climate in many ways. The four principal ways that

Page 170

living things affect climate are (1) through evaporation and uptake (condensation) of
water, (2) exchange of other trace gases including greenhouse gases. (3) changing the
reflectance of large surface areas of Earth, and (4) changing the roughness index (the
way that winds at and near the surface are slowed by the surface).

As I have written in various scientific papers since the 1970s, the result is a
global life-supporting and life—containing system that we only partially understand (see
my attached list of climate—change—related publications). It is arrogant of us to claim that
we understand this incredibly complex system to the extent that we can make firm
forecasts, especially given the current failure of climate models to forecast recent
temperature changes. To paraphrase the famous thinker Buckminster Fuller, we are
born onto a planet that did not come with an instruction manual.

In short, we don’t fully understand how our planet’s life supporting system works,
and our difficult but fascinating scientific investigation is still in its very early stages.
How unfortunate, then, that how Earth’s climate works has been turned into a political
debate that assumes we know all we need to know about it to make decisions that will
have many large scale effects.

At the hearing. the statement was made repeatedly by the four EPA
administrators that 97% of scientists agreed that human—caused global warming was
happening I would like to clarify the basis for that assertion and what the facts actually
are as discussed in the paper “Climate Consensus and ‘Misinformation’: A Rejoinder to
Agnotology, Scientific Consensus, and the Teaching and Learning of Climate Change.”[1]
This paper reanalyzes the basis for the statement that 97% of scientists agree that our
addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is causing a major global warming and
concludes “Inspection of a claim by Cook et al. (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of
97.1 % consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3%
endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is
anthropogenic.” it is not 97% of scientists that agree about global warming, but less
than 1%, according to this paper.

None of the four EPA administrators are scientists. They were simply repeating
the standard assertions that are made, which, as l discussed, are an inaccurate
assessment of what scientists in general believe to be the case. But most important.
science is not a majority—rule process. it is an analysis based on what the facts show.
There are many cases in the history of science those in political and ideological control
strongly opposed findings by scientists, with very negative results. Two obvious
examples are Galileo and the Pope; and in the USSR, centralized political control over
genetics and agriculture by Trofim Lysenko, the director of the Soviet Union's Lenin
All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Lysenkoism. “Lysenkoism” was a theory
that acquired characteristics could be inherited. For example, if you cut off the tales of
rats, their offspring would lack tales. Even though it departed completely from the then

Brenchley 2013, Climate Consensus and ‘Misinformation': A Rejoinder to Agnotology,
Scientific Consensus, and the Teaching and Learning of Climate Change, Science &
Education. (10.1007/511191-013—9647—9) August 2013,

Page 171

and now well-accepted Darwinian evolutionary theory, Lysenkoism was the required
rule in the Soviet Union and Darwinian evolution was suppressed, greatly damaging
biological research in the Soviet Union.

In a democracy with freedom of speech, scientific findings must speak
themselves, not drawn out by the repeated mouthings of half-truths by nonscientists.

For those not familiar with the bases of the scientific method, i recommend
chapter 2 in my textbook with Professor Edward A. Keller, Environmental Science: Earth
as a Living Planet.

Regarding whether "delay could mean that warming becomes ‘Locked in’ there
are two problems with this assertion. first, carbon dioxide has varied greatly over the
geological ages and has never gotten permanently “locked into” a specific concentration
in the atmosphere. The same can be said for Earth’s average temperature.

Second, such a statement arises from a specific kind of theory about the climate
as a system, a theory that assumes climate without human action achieves and remains
at a steady state, at a constant concentration. To the contrary, well—accepted findings
from such research as the Antarctic Ice Cores show that the climate has always
changed, has never been in a steady-state. it is therefore a non-steady—state system,
and a theory it to be steady—state is bound to be wrong in general and in many specific
ways. This is also a point l have made repeatedly in my scientific papers.

Steady-state systems, like the Empire State Building, remain in a constant
condition unless tipped too far. This is what lies behind claims that the climate may be
at or near a “tipping point." Earth’s climate is inherently non-steady-state and it is an
incorrect description of such a system to claim that something like the concentration of a
greenhouse gas or Earth’s temperature could be “locked-in.”

Put more simply, how Earth’s biosphere (the global life-containing and life-
supporting system) is just beginning to be understood, and there are. of course, many
different theoretical approaches to explain how this system works. At present we do not
know enough to make claims about whether any of Earth’s systems could be definitely
characterized as having “tipping points,” and especially whether any aspect of the
climate is about to be “locked in."

2. During the hearing, you sought to comment on assertions that linked sea
level rise to C02 emissions. Could you elaborate for the record upon sea level rise
in general and correlation with CO2 emissions? Please provide any charts, data
sets, or peer—reviewed papers you feel relevant.

Let me make clear first of all that my primary research has been on terrestrial
ecosystems and my speciality is not oceanography. Measurements of sea level rise are
themselves difficult and subject to scientific questions about consistency over time and
location, and experts in this field are actively discussing whether there has been an
increase in the rate of sea level rise during the twentieth century. Forecasting how sea
level will rise in the future is even more difficult and uncertain and is a major subject of
current research. For example, a major scientific paper concerning sea level rise stated
that “Uncertainties in sea—level projections for the 21st century have focused ice sheet

modelling efforts to include the processes that are thought to be contributing to the
recently observed rapid changes at ice sheet margins. This effort is still in its infancy,
however, leaving us unable to make reliable predictions of ice sheet responses to a
warming climate if such glacier accelerations were to increase in size and frequency.”

Reconstructions of past sea—level rise show considerable variation of the past
17,000 years, depending on the rate at which glaciers melted, and this poses a problem
beyond my expertise for forecasting changes today into the future.3

I am not expert enough about this subject to comment further, except to point out
the following: Several things about sea level are well known and well accepted relating
to this question of sea level rise and CO2 emissions. Most important, sea level has
been rising since the end of the last ice age, approximately 12,500 years ago. This is
so well known that even a book for lay people about environmental problems in Venice,
Italy, The Science of Saving Venice,‘ states that “during the last great ice age, the
landscape [of Venice} was very different. The sea was 100 meters lower than it is today
. . . the seas rose as the ice age ended," The standard estimate is that as a result of
the natural melting of the continental glaciers and natural warming trend since the end
of that last ice age, the sea level has risen approximately one to two feet a century.
Many discussions of sea level rise and CO2 concentration ignore this natural process
and present the situation as if all sea level rise was the result of human activities that
are increasing the concentration of this gas in the atmosphere. On the contrary, effects
of our additions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is in addition to the background
natural rate of sea level rise.
