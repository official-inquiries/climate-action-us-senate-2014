Senator WHITEHOUSE. Now, finally, we have Dr. Mason. Please 
proceed, sir. 
STATEMENT OF JOSEPH R. MASON, HERMANN MOYSE, JR./ 
LOUISIANA BANKERS ASSOCIATION ENDOWED PROFESSOR 
OF BANKING, LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY AND SENIOR 
FELLOW, THE WHARTON SCHOOL 

Mr. MASON. Good morning and thank you for inviting me to tes-
tify here today on this crucially important topic. 
My research specialty throughout my career has been market 
failures and crises. I began studying cap and trade markets in 2005 
as the EU system became a reality and quickly began to fail. 
I did so because of the preternatural push among lawmakers to 
embark upon cap and trade solutions despite widespread consensus 
among economists that cap and trade does not suit carbon emis-
sions. 

With respect to Chairman Boxer’s earlier medical analogy, I do 
not disagree with the diagnosis here but with the proposed treat-
ment. You are all presupposing that the treatment is known. It is 
not. 

In recent history, no system, not the EU, the RGGI or the Cali-
fornia Initiative has priced carbon at levels prohibitive to emis-
sions. Prices currently hover at just $5 on the RGGI, $11 in Cali-
fornia and between those two levels in the EU. It is widely viewed 
that prices in excess of $30 are necessary to cut emissions. 
The recent EPA proposal seems to be merely an attempt to speci-
fy quantity goals instead of price goals. There are two problems 
with this approach. 

First, to control quantity, one has to actually be in control of the 
thing one targets. The U.S. Federal Reserve wanted this years ago 
when it had to move away from targeting the money supply be-
cause so many near money substitutes existed that it really had no 
effectiveness just monitoring cash and checking account balances. 
In carbon markets, the common policy of carbon permit 
fungibility has always rendered this quantity targeting unwork-
able. In a series of famous cases, the EU high court ruled that EU 
member states have sovereignty over the amount of permits they 
issue. 

In one famous case in 2010 when invalid permits infiltrated 
BlueNext, the exchange had to close for 3 days while the permits 
could be isolated and swapbacks could be arranged for them to be 
removed from the market. 

Second, as an economist, it does not matter which side of the 
price quantity coin you look at, the effects are the same. Quantity 
will go down only if price goes up. When real prices go up, output 
declines and unemployment increases. 

Corporations already forego billions of dollars of investment due 
to anticipated carbon prices and States in which those corporations 
operate will feel the effects of this new policy. It is important to 
remember, however, those are not just oil and gas companies but 
companies like Walt Disney and Wal-Mart. 
In preparing for this hearing, I regressed the State EPA goals 
normalized for each State’s percent of power from coal in 2013 on 
a number of very important variables. Perhaps most importantly,

the regression shows that States with lagging economies coming 
out of the great recession have tougher goals to meet than others. 
Certainly there are simple adjustments that can be made to miti-
gate the effects of carbon policy upon economic growth if we just 
think about those for a moment. 

No government has yet accepted the lower economic growth nec-
essary to meaningfully curb carbon emissions. Officials know prices 
should go up but cannot bear the political heat of restricting per-
mits to achieve that goal. 

In fact, in March 2014, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, 
George Osborne, announced the government would freeze attacks 
on carbon emissions as part of a broad plan to cut consumer energy 
bills. While his party backs carbon reform, consumer energy costs 
have become a campaign plank for the opposition which vowed to 
freeze energy prices if they win in mid–2015. 

A similar issue is growing in Germany which is subsidized re-
newables growth with a mandatory household surcharge on elec-
tricity and voters are not happy. 

By far, the worst effects of carbon markets have been the regu-
latory arbitrage fraud and theft that have occurred on such sys-
tems. If we are not ready to deal with the existing corporate fraud 
and bribery, tax fraud, investor fraud, counterfeiting, money laun-
dering, hacking and phishing on carbon markets that have troubled 
established markets in recent years, we should not be discussing 
their implementation in the largest economy in the world. 
Denying the failure of existing carbon policy risks raising energy 
prices without reducing carbon output. U.N. climate talks on car-
bon broke down this week over this simple economic fact. 
Extending my analogy with central banking, Members of Con-
gress should remember that the National Monetary Commission 
studied central bank functions around the world for 7 years before 
concluding upon the design of the U.S. Federal Reserve system. 
Let us take our time now and research existing carbon abate-
ment mechanisms before emulating demonstratively failed schemes 
around the world, enriching financial industry interest groups at 
the cost of our economy while continuing to allow carbon to grow 
as a national and global problem. 

Thank you.

The US government is once again pursuing cap and trade mechanisms. As an economist, I have
to say I have no idea why.

Since I am not a climate scientist I cannot opine from more than a lay perspective on whether
there is a consensus in the discipline on man-made global warming. Since I am an economist,
however, 1 can say that there exists a wholesale consensus among economists that carbon is not
well-suited for cap and trade.

Moreover, existing markets in the US and EU have failed to price carbon at levels that lead to
reduced carbon emissions because to do so would be costly to economic growth. The question of
“who can issue the permits” continues to drag down the effectiveness of the EU system, and
poses considerable problems for the proposed state~level system in the US. There is no plan for
investing the proceeds from permit sales in developing clean technology. And existing carbon
markets have been prone to fraud, theft, and counterfeiting worldwide. All of this is widely
reported and known throughout the world. Jumping in with our eyes closed to such crucial
developments exposes US citizens and the US, and world, economies to unnecessary risk.

Below, I review recent evidence on the shortcomings of cap and trade, concluding that we should
emulate the historical approach we took to establishing a central bank after the Panic of 1907:
take our time and study what works and what does not so that we design an effective system that
does not pose unnecessary costs upon our nation.

I. The Price of Carbon on Cap and Trade Markets Has Not Achieved Levels to
Restrain Output

Cap and trade does not work for carbon. The reasons for that failure are multi-faceted, but the
simple fact is that even existing markets have not priced carbon at levels that restrain output for
many years now.

The ETS has suffered from a drastic oversupply of carbon permits for quite some time. In
October 2009, Peter Zapfel, assistant to the deputy director general of the environment
department at the European Commission, said the oversupply of government allowances is
threatening to overwhelm the system. At the time, many newer EU members from Central and
Eastern Europe contributed a huge oversupply of credits. These counties have excess credits that
numbered roughly five times the number in European market, depressing prices and undermining
carbon reduction goals the market was formed to support.[1]

Since then, little has changed. In fact, by January 2013, record low auction bids from utilities,
factories and banks led Germany to cancel an auction of European Union emission permits for
the first time, ever. Connie Hedegaard, the EU’s climate chief, said the cancellation should be a
“wake—up call” for those who do not support the plan to strengthen the emissions trading

system.[2] At the close of trading on Friday, June 13, 2014, EU carbon was trading at 5.71 euro.
far short of the 20—euro level needed to prompt industry and utilities to invest in greener energy.[3]

The US is following a similar path by emulating the EU system instead of learning from its
problems. Currently there are two markets in US: one in California (California Air Resources
Board) and the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGl) in Northeast. Neither
prices carbon at levels that restrict carbon emissions.

Most recently, it was reported that California companies bought all 16.95 million allowances to
release carbon emissions at the state’s May 16, 2014 cap—and-trade auction. The price for the
carbon allowances was $11.50 each, slightly higher than the previous two auctions in February
and November, each of which sold allowances for $11.48 each. An additional 4 million permits
that can’t be used until 2017, of the 9.2 million that were available, sold at $11.36.

Analysts at Thompson Reuters Point Carbon expect prices to hover just above the program’s
auction floor price of $11.34 a metric ton through 2014. Earlier this year, analysts predicted
California carbon prices would remain low through 2020 due to excess permits.[4]

“The price for power plants to emit one ton of carbon dioxide in nine northeastern U.S. states
cleared at a record high $5.02 per short ton at the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative’s (RGGI)
23rd permit auction,” the market's administrator said on Friday, June 6, 2014.[5]

The sad fact for politicians is that markets are doing exactly what we economists expect them to
do. There is virtually no disagreement among economists that the true cost to society of burning
a ton of carbon is greater than its private cost. However, “agreeing that the [social cost of carbon]
is greater than zero isn’t really agreeing on very much.”[6] The market, in fact, is pricing the most
likely environmental scenarios, for which temperature increases are moderate and effects are
small, putting carbon in roughly the $10 to $40 range.

But that is precisely what markets do. Markets price the “expected" value. If we want to prices to
reflect more dramatic outcomes we will have to use a carbon tax. In short, just like in the recent
financial crisis, markets are doing what they are supposed to do. Back then, politicians did not
like the fact that markets were telling us that a meltdown was coming. Here, politicians do not
like the fact that markets pricing the most likely (but not most destructive) scenarios, and they

will not do anything else. Either way, markets are telling us the unvarnished truth, whether we
like it or not.

II. Announcing a Quantity Target is No Different

One of the hallmarks of the EPA’s recent proposal is to establish carbon intensity goals, in effect
setting quantity targets rather than price targets that have been the focus of prior carbon
abatement mechanisms.

To a monetary economist, however, a quantity target is just the flip side of a price target.
Through the history of modern central banking, the US Federal Reserve has experimented with
both. For certain periods of time, the Federal Reserve used quantity targets (i.e., M l) and for
others, price targets (i.e., the Fed Funds rate). There is no clear evidence that one is superior to
the other. In fact, in some periods of history quantities worked fine, while in other prices were
superior. Thus, it will be an economic question whether price or quantity is a better target.

It is unclear whether the quantities set are correct, meaningful, or achievable, If they are
incorrect, they will be so because they either have no effect on carbon output or they are
economically unachievable. If they are unachievable, they will be challenged by the relevant
states and, most likely, altered.

The possibility of alteration by Congressional or administrative fiat, however, is precisely the
political risk that has contributed price volatility to the EU system. Critics complain that carbon
price volatility and the market’s exposure to political risk mean the system does not encourage
companies to invest in emission reduction, because the goals may be ultimately changed (or
firms can lobby for change).[7]

III. Any effective program WILL restrain economic growth
But to begin with, we will first have to set some truly restrictive targets. It is doubtful, however,
that meaningfully restrictive targets will arise from Congressional or administrative fiat because
elected officials do not like to restrain growth, such decisions will force them to pick winners
and losers, and states, industries, and even groups of consumers will have to be chosen.

A. The effects of carbon goals will be uneven

Widespread press coverage already noted the disparity of the goals across states. The financial
Times’ Ed Crooks immediately noted that the states with the most demanding targets included

7 financial Times (USA); Date: Dec 7, 2009; Section: Investing in commodities; Page: SR7-6.

Page 193

Arizona, South Carolina, Oregon, and New Hampshire, while states with least demanding targets
included Maine, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and Iowa.[8]

Moreover, Crooks noted that there was perhaps a tenuous connection between goals and actual
carbon dioxide states will emit.[9] Bloomberg Energy finance reported that California, Nebraska,
Rhode Island can actually increase volume of emissions in absolute terms. Louisiana, Arkansas,
Idaho will face the largest cuts. [10]

In its ground—breaking “Clean Power Plan ” released 2 June, the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to work with 49 states to slash the C02 intensity of
fossil-fuel power generation by 2030. The headlines were simple enough: US plans to cut
its emissions 30% from 2005 levels. But what the regulation actually does is lay out a
series of convoluted state-level targets designed to reduce the carbon intensity of
states’ power.[11]

Heightening the probability of political risk and disruptive volatility, “President Barack Obama’s
plan to cut power plants’ carbon dioxide emissions places a widely differing burden on different
states, opening the proposals to objections from those that feel they are being treated unfairly."
Jacob Hollinger, a former EPA lawyer who is now a partner at McDermott, Will & Emery, was
quoted as saying he was “’surprised’ by the differences in the demands made of different states.
‘The implications aren’t totally developed yet, and that is something people should be
scrutinizing very carefully,m he said. [12]

My own analysis suggests that the differences in goals among states are also related to politics.
In preparing for this hearing, I regressed the goals multiplied by each states’ percent of power
from coal in 2013[13] (to adjust the goals for existing carbon intensity) on each states’ GSP and
employment change from 2007 to the most recent quarter, as well as variables related to the
Democrat’s “political productivity" of each state in the 2012 elections. [14]

[13] The range of the dependent variable is -0.96 to +0.35, since some states are allowed to increase, overall.

[14] The theory of political productivity starts with the notion that a state that cannot be won regardless of
what favoritism is directed their way is not worth pursuing, as is one that the party knows they will win
regardless of what favoritism is directed their way. Thus, swing states are the ones that parties favor,
because grants or programs benefitting those states can have the most “productivity" in elections. The
method has been applied to examining the distribution of Federal grants and expenditures from the Great
Depression to today.

Page 194

The regression shows that the EPA’s goals are inversely related to GSP growth between 2007
and the most recent quarter (in other words, states with higher change in GSP from 2007 to the
most recent quarter less restrictive goals, punishing states with lagging economies coming out of
the recession) and the effect is statistically significant. The EPA’s (normalized) goals are
positively related to unemployment (states with less of a recovery in unemployment since 2007
have less restrictive goals to meet), though the effect statistically insignificant at conventional
levels. Political productivity for the Democratic Party, however, is positive and statistically
significant suggesting the EPA’s goals would have benefitted the Democrats in the past
presidential election. Assuming 2016 is similar, the distribution of EPA goals among states will
benefit them then, too.

B. The unevenness of the EPA’s goals will affect state-level jobs and growth

It has been clear from applications, worldwide, that companies that do business in regions in
which carbon is priced will build carbon costs into their investment and planning decisions. For
instance, Shell Vice President Angus Gillespie has stated publicly that climate policies can cost
potential investment projects “hundreds of millions of dollars" and that “there are opportunities
we have not progressed because of the $40 a ton" carbon cost estimate that they use internally in
their capital budgeting process. [15]

But it is not just energy companies that price carbon costs into their planned investments. At
least twenty—eight US companies are known to report the carbon prices that they use for internal
capital budgeting, including: Delphi Automotive, Walt Disney, ConAgra Foods, Walmart,
Apache Corporation, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, ExxonMobil, Hess, Shell,
Wells Fargo, Cummins, Delta Air Lines, General Electric, Google, Jabil Circuit, Microsoft, El
du Pont de Nemours, Ameren, American Electrical Power, CMS Energy, Duke Energy, Entergy,
Integrys Energy, PG&E and Xcel Energy. [16]

First, note the diversity of those companies, including energy firms like Exxon, consumer firms
such as Walmart, and even entertainment firms like Disney. Clearly, carbon costs affect a broad
swath of our economy.

But even more interesting is the diversity of carbon prices used by each of those firms. Prices
range from $10—$20 at Disney to $60 at Exxon, and a wide variety of prices in between. As
previously stated, carbon price volatility has been an enduring feature of the EU market and
political risk in the EU and the US continues to contribute to widely disparate views of the price
of carbon in the future, as a result.

Page 195

C. Economic effects will hit consumers, as well

The broad industry exposure to carbon prices illustrated above will undoubtedly affect
consumers, not just in their utility bills but in all manner of expenditures. So far, the impact on
utility bills is expected to be modest, but this expectation seems to be based on natural gas prices
remaining low.

Further investment in renewables and other energy sources will undoubtedly push up consumer
costs.

According to the International Energy Agency, global investment in the energy sector will need
to reach $38tn between 2011 and 2035, based on existing trends. Almost $17tn of this will be for
electrical power, covering generation, transmission and distribution. Citi analysts said in a report
in September that, while renewables are forecast to make up 50 per cent of additional power
output capacity by 2035, they will cost $5.9m, against $3.9m for conventional sources.[17]

One of the most radical transformations in electrical power is happening in Germany, “where the
government has committed to phasing out nuclear power stations and switching to renewable
energies within a decade.” But new installation of subsidized wind and solar is pushing up
electricity prices for consumers. Guaranteed prices for electricity from renewable sources have
encouraged investors to build new capacity. The higher prices, however, have come at the
expense of consumers in the form of increased energy bills, in order to pay green energy
generators an estimated €20.4bn in feed—in tariffs in 2013. [18]

As a result, in October 2013, the country‘s grid operators raised the mandatory surcharge on
units of electricity to a record 5.3 cents per kWh for 2014, up from 3.6 cents. “For a typical
household using 3500 kWh per year, this surcharge would rise from €125 to €185. The move is
all the more contentious as many businesses are exempted, to protect their international
competitiveness.” [19]

IV. ...but if it doesn’t also restrain carbon, it is all pain and no gain...

A. Governments don’t have the appetite for restraining economic growth (that’s why
we have independent central banks)

As a result of such obvious costs, no system has yet to restrain carbon permit issues to levels that
meaningfully restrict carbon output. Even though Germany has come around to imposing costs
of developing renewable energy sources on individual consumers, carbon prices are still too low

17 “Green agenda prompts pricing concerns,” Financial Times Special Report on Energy, November 5,
2012 at 2.

Page 196

to restrict output. Thus, Germany’s is a pure subsidy-driven plan, not a carbon market—driven
plan.

Germany, in fact, cancelled an auction in January 2013 due to record low bids from utilities,
factories and banks forced Germany to cancel a sale for the first time. Connie Hedegaard, the
EU’s climate chief said afterward, “the need to fix the market is getting urgent.” Johannes
Teyssen, chief executive officer of EON SE, Germany’s biggest power utility, said in an
interview with Manager Magazine that the EU greenhouse gas trading system is now, “a joke the
whole world laughs about.” Matthew Gray, an analyst in London at Jefferies Group Inc, opined
that some buyers will probably wait for prices to drop further and the commission has limited
influence to contain the market’s decline. The problem is, when the bloc set the program’s cap
before 2008, it didn’t install a system for dealing with a supply glut.[20]

In December 2013, EU Parliament finally voted to backload (delay) sales of 900 million carbon
permits. Matthias Groote, the German Socialist lawmaker who steered the legislation through
parliament, argued that, “backloading is not enough. The market is still oversupplied by 2 billion
permits, but this buys us time to have a discussion on how to reform it." Still, the proposal
caused “fierce divisions within member states, national governments and the European
Parliament over fears it will push up energy prices and dent economic growth.”[21]

As a result of the decision, the benchmark December 2013 EU Allowance futures ended the
trading day at 4.90 euros. Assuming the first allowances will be withheld from the market in the
second half of 2014, Marcus Ferdinand, an analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, “forecast
the Dec-14 carbon price will increase by 35 percent compared to this years’ (mean) price, to an
average of 6 euros.” Analysts predicted prices could eventually double due to backloading, but
that it would still be years before they rise above the 20-euro level needed to prompt industry and
utilities to invest in greener energy. Some EU lawmakers believe the bloc‘s carbon market will
be irrelevant without further reform. [22]

On the March 19, 2014, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announce the
government would freeze a tax on carbon emissions starting in April 2016 as part of a broad plan
to cut consumer energy bills. Consumer energy costs have become a campaign plank, with Prime
Minister David Cameron’s administration coming under pressure to rein in rising energy costs as
a result of Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, vowing in November to freeze
energy prices if he wins the next election in mid—2015. That move prompted the government in

to announce measures cutting green levies by 50 pounds per household a year in December
2013.[23]

As of Monday, June 16, 2014, “the use of carbon markets to curb rising greenhouse gas
emissions was dealt a blow on Sunday after two weeks of United Nations talks on designing and
reforming the mechanisms ended in deadlock?”[24]

At the close of trading on June 13, 2014, the price was 5.71 euros.

B. Arguments abound over who decides the supply of permits, and this new Federal
layer will intensify those in the US

Part of the problem in Europe has been jurisdiction over the issuance of carbon permits.

In 2007, the EU executive rejected Poland‘s national allocation plan (NAP), which set its total
emission allocations and outlined how it intended to distribute them to individual factories
covered by the scheme. The EU ’5 main objection was that countries like Poland intended to
allocate too many allowances. [25]

In September 2009, the Commission’s decision was overturned by the European Court of first
Instance (the General Court). “The court found that member states alone can take the final
decision on the total number of allowances to allocate, and ruled that the EU executive had
misused its powers.” That decision also ruled on disagreements with Slovakia, the first country
to take the issue to the court, and Estonia. All three countries argued that the EU’s limits were
too low and would hurt their economics. [26]

In 2013, a Superior Court judge in California rejected a private legal challenge to California’s
carbon auctions. In that action, the California Chamber of Commerce and Pacific Legal
Foundation, on behalf of a dozen clients including Morning Star Packing Company and Dalton
Trucking, had filed lawsuits in Sacramento Superior Court to block the carbon allowances.[27]
While I am not qualified to opine on the legal details, it seems to me that this ruling sets the
framework for a similar problem to that of the EU member states where, regardless of the EPA’s
goals, states’ rights to set permit levels may not be able to be challenged.

C. There is no appetite for using proceeds of carbon permit sales to invest in new
technology

Since carbon prices remain depressed. California’s quarterly permit auctions will only raise $21
billion for the period through 2020, well below the anticipated $60 billion in revenue.28

Sales have raised $396 million for the state so far, and that money was initially intended to be
devoted to efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions by subsidizing renewables and new
technologies. Instead, however, Governor Jerry Brown decided to, “lend $500 million from the
funds to the California state legislature to plug gaps in the state‘s budget,” The state is supposed
to repay the state-run greenhouse gas emissions reduction account at a later date.[29]

Perhaps California can come around. The California Legislature announced Monday, June 16,
2014 that it had approved a $108 billion spending plan for the 2014-15 fiscal year that included,
“$250 million for the High-Speed Rail project, along with 25 percent of future cap=and-trade
funds. . .. Lawmakers also agreed to spend $200 million using cap-and-trade revenue on low-
carbon transportation projects and $130 million on affordable housing projects near mass
transit.”[30] Of course, that budget is subject to approval by Governor Jerry Brown. But even if he
approves, the on-again, off-again nature of green commitments in California will make it
difficult for firms to commit to providing jobs and growth in that sector in the long-run.

Even devoting carbon permit revenues to mass transit, new technologies and renewables,
however, has been derided as unjustifiable. “Those most vulnerable to climate change are often
least responsible for its causes, and have the fewest resources to deal with its consequences.”[31]

The revenues could support vulnerable countries’ efforts to develop long term plans to
deal with climate change, as well as finance pilot projects aimed at minimizing loss and
damage... They could fund the monitoring and forecasting of slow-onset and extreme—
weather events, enabling authorities and the public to prepare more effectively for an
impending disaster. And the money could cover loss—and-damage risk premiums on
individual, local, national. regional, or international insurance policies. [32]

V. Worse yet, if carbon markets just benefit Wall Street then they just create new
interest groups to capture the government and the financial markets

The Interpol Environmental Crime Programme now lists ten classifications of carbon crimes that
have already occurred throughout the world and continue to remain a threat.[34] Those include:
* Manipulating measurements to fraudulently claim additional carbon credits
(Additionality);
Sale of carbon credits that either do not exist or belong to someone else;
* False or misleading claims with respect to the environmental or financial benefits of
carbon market investments;
* Exploitation of weak regulations to commit financial crimes;
* Tax Fraud;
* Securities Fraud;
* Transfer mispricing;
* Money laundering;
* Internet crimes and computer hacking to steal carbon credits; and
* Phishing/Theft of personal information or identity theft.

Some environmentalists even get it. Friends of the Earth has recognized such crimes and, as a
result, advocates a carbon tax rather than cap and trade.35

Still, politicians remain preternaturally attracted to cap and trade, even as carbon markets
continue to grow and problems continue to mount.

A. Investor Fraud

As carbon markets grow, the carbon fund market has grown. as well. Carbon funds — like mutual
funds with stocks or bonds — accept (private or public) investor money to purchase carbon
permits. According to the latest survey by Carbon finance, a carbon market data service
published by Environmental Finance, over 2008-09, funds under management grew by 20 per
cent to $16.1bn (£9.8bn, €10.7bn). The number of carbon funds and government purchase
programs increased from 80 to 88. 36

36 “Carbon funds grow despite problems." financial Times, Dec 7, 2009; Page: SR7—6.

Page 200

Mark Nicholls, editor of Environmental Finance, who published the survey noted that, “thirty—
eight of the 88 funds listed are governmental carbon purchasing vehicles, or are run by multi~
laterals either for governments or emitting companies, or a combination. The majority of the
remainder are open to institutional investors.” “Of the 12 funds that were launched since the
2008-09 edition, only two were governmental or multilateral; the rest were private sector
vehicles.”[37]

The returns can be lucrative. “The European Carbon Fund, run by French bank Natixis and one
of the earliest run to generate a cash return, says that based on its net asset value at the end of
2008, the fund has generated an annual return of 27.8 per cent since its inception in April
2005”[38]

The problem is that such returns quickly attract fraudulent schemes.

Interpol reported that in 2009 and 2010, an Australian investment firm ran an aggressive
telemarketing strategy advertising false connections to legitimate organizations and
environmental standards. Potential investors were offered a high return investment opportunity in
carbon credits. The firm is estimated to have defrauded Australian victims of $3.2 million. [39]

The FTAlphaville warned of a firm called “Enviro Associates” that was selling voluntary carbon
credits for investment purposes, all the while warning that:

Voluntary Carbon Credits were not designed to be purchased for investment purposes:
for that reason Carbon Credits (VERs) are not for all specifications of Investors due to
its high risk and undeveloped market landscape and uncertainty...

Individuals should be aware if they are purchasing for speculative means that there is
little or no liquidity at present in the market which in turn would affect your ability to
sell/exit from a holding at this time. This may change in the future. [40]

Enviro Associates claims to be a “clearing member” of Gemmax Solutions, a payments and
clearing service. Britain’s financial Conduct Authority warns, however, that:

Several unauthorized firms promoting and selling carbon credits are telling investors
that carbon Neutral Investments Limited (CNI) or Gemmax Solutions, firms authorized by

be protected as though they are dealing with an authorized firm. But this is incorrect. [41]
Without investor protection and regulatory oversight, carbon schemes continue to proliferate

Britain‘s financial Services Authority summarizes warnings to investors about carbon frauds and
emphasizes that they do not regulate carbon credits in the same manner as shares of stock.[42] Still,
investors flock to these green “investment” opportunities.

in November 2013, Britain’s FSA reported that it had shut down nineteen companies in the past
fifteen months for bilking roughly 1,500 investors out of 24 million pounds ($38.7 million)
through selling carbon credits to individual investors.[43]

The UK Insolvency Service said the firms mainly targeted the elderly with high pressure sales
techniques and promises of hefty returns of more than 40 percent. "Salesmen played on peoples'
keenness to ‘do their bit‘ to save the environment while making an investment at the same time,"
the Service said in a statement. [44]

The FCA in September released the findings of a survey of 125 carbon investors, showing not
one had made any money from investing in the credits.[45]

The watchdog said some 183 carbon firms have been put under investigation since 201 l and has
listed many of them on its website.[46]

In the US, carbon schemes have prompted several States Attorneys General, including those of
California, Vermont, Arkansas, Delaware, Maine, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Illinois, Connecticut
and New Hampshire, to back efforts by the Federal Trade Commission to investigate consumer
fraud in the carbon offsets market.[47]

B. Corporate Fraud

Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects generate carbon credits based on the extent to
which the project resulted in fewer emissions than would otherwise have occurred. Dan Welch,
of The Guardian, wrote, “Offsets are an imaginary commodity created by deducting what you
hope happens from what you guess would have happened.”[48]

Companies, therefore, have an incentive to either inflate the estimate of emissions that would
have occurred without the project or claim that the project will reduce emission by more than it
actually does.

In order to constrain firms from mischaracterizing their projects, the CDM mechanism requires
third-party validation and verification before a project receives carbon credits. Third-party
verification is carried out by Designated Operation Entities (DOES) certified by the CDM
Executive Board.

liven independent third party auditors, however, may be susceptible to bribes or collusion to
manipulate the results.

According to Transparency International, bribery is most common at the project approval stage.
“Although kickbacks to officials have not been reported, a Russian agency reportedly asked for
direct monetary payments. In South-east Asian countries, it is fairly common for developers to
invite the authorities to workshops (with attractive per diems) before submitting projects for
approval. In China, it is not uncommon for project developers to invite experts reviewing their
projects to dinner.”[49]

But even independent verification agencies are not immune to manipulation. In 2008 and 2009
respectively the UN temporarily suspended two independent organizations A Norwegian
company Det Norske Veritas and Swiss firm SGS — after “spot checks found flaws in their
methodologies.”[50] Investigations showed that both companies had approved projects without
sufficient review.“

“The UN inspection found one company had a flawed review process, inadequate preparation
and training of their auditing staff, and an overall failure to assign auditors with the proper
technical skills. The other was suspended after an inspection raised concerns about staff
qualifications and the quality of its internal reviews."52

In a follow-up review in 2009 the five largest DOEs’ validation processes were scored on an A-
to-F scale. None received a score higher than a D. [53]

C. Permit Fraud

1. Counterfeiting

There are many example of fake or invalid carbon permits being sold to unwitting buyers.

In one infamous and convoluted example, in March 2010, the Hungarian government took
possession of two million carbon credits which had been surrendered to them by Hungarian
businesses.

The rules of the EU—ETS allowed the Hungarian government to legally sell these carbon credits
to others because Hungary anticipated being below its Kyoto Protocol target. However, the EU
rules prevented these credits from being re-used within the EU.[54] Thus, Hungary sold the carbon
credits to Hungarian Energy Power, ‘with restrictions that they were ineligible for use in Europe
and notified the European Commission of the sale "55 “Hungarian Energy Power then sold the
credits to a British trading company, which resold them to a firm in Hong Kong The Hong Kong
firm however, then put those same recycled carbon credits on BlueNext, a Paris carbon
exchange“, where a number of European brokers and banks purchased them not knowing the
carbon credits had already been used in Europe.”57

When BlueNext discovered the credits were ineligible for use in the EU, the exchange
“immediately suspended trading sending the spot price for CERS spiraling downward.”58 After
shutting down for three days to isolate the problem credits, BlueNext facilitated “swap backs,”59
in which tae sellers bought back the credits. Prices rose to their previous levels when trading
reopened.[60]

While the European Commission has now closed the loophole that allowed the credits to re—enter
the EU-ETS,[61] the episode highlights the importance of“strong regulations for monitoring the
transfer of carbon credits through several foreign exchanges, particularly cross—checking between
those exchanges.”[62]

2. Theft

Carbon permits are also the target of hackers. A hacking attack in November of 2010 resulted in
the theft of 1.6 million carbon credits (valued at €235 million) from the Romanian registry
account of Holcim Ltd, the world’s second largest cement-maker.”[63] Holcim immediately posted
the identification numbers of the stolen credits on its website and law enforcement efforts
between Romania and Liechtenstein were able to track and return 600,000 of the stolen credits.64
Still, while the unique identification number of the carbon credits allowed them to be tracked,
not all the credits could be returned to Holcim. As it turned out, some “jurisdictions required the
holder to return the stolen credits to the legal owner at the holder’s loss, while other jurisdictions
allowed the buyer to keep them, with the original owner carrying the loss.”65

In another high-proflle incident, the European Union’s emissions trading system was shut down
for a week afler cyber—thieves stole emissions allowances worth €7m ($9.4m) from an account in
the Czech Republic, while criminals also hacked into trading accounts in Austria, Poland, Greece
and Estonia. “The Commission proposed tighter security measures in 2010 after discovering that
hackers had broken into the registries where allowances are stored,” but member states have
repeatedly claimed they cannot afford the improvements. [66] It is easy to imagine a similar
situation arising in US markets where states would have to bear such unexpected costs.

VI. Conclusion and Policy Recommendations

Economists agree, cap and trade does not work for carbon. So why do politicians continue to
pursue such mechanisms? It seems to me that while some paint “climate deniers" as a problem in
Congress, an equally troubling problem is “cap and trade failure deniers.” Perhaps politicians
think that adopting a “market” based solution will get them off the hook for tough decisions on
carbon tax rates. But, unfortunately for the rest of us, doing so only exposes the US economy to
new sources of fraud, theft, and risk of loss while raising energy prices WITHOUT reducing
carbon output.

In fact, the conclusions of the House of Commons, Energy and Climate Change Committee,
“The EU Emissions Trading System,” Tenth Report of Session 2010—l 2, Volume I, 17 January
2012 (at 129), summarize my testimony as well, if not better, than I can write on my own:

Some proponents of the ETS suggest that the main flows are rules that have been
designed inadequately or have been badly applied, and could be reformed. We suggest
that s are ofa structural nature. The ETS is a market in a commodity that has
been created by legislative/int. The European Commission is both the supplier and the
regulator of carbon as a commodity, a situation which has made the E TS particularlv
susceptible to rent—seeking behaviour. This should come as no surprise, since the history
ofemissions trading is littered with evidence that it helps companies and governments to
pre-empt and delay making the structural changes necessary to address climate
change.

This crucial task of reducing carbon emissions needs to be handled with care, lest we merely
repeat the mistakes already experienced by established markets. We can’t afford such setbacks.

Extending the analogy with central banking, members of Congress should remember that the
National Monetary Commission studies central bank functions around the world for seven years
before concluding upon the design of the US Federal Reserve System, having experienced two
failed central banks before it. Let’s take our time now and research existing carbon abatement
mechanisms before embarking upon another two (or more) failed schemes that will enrich
interest groups while continuing to allow carbon to grow as a national, and global, problem.

Follow-UpQuestions for Written Submission, Mason

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse

I. In your testimony you indicated that there is “virtually no disagreement among economists that the true cost to society of burning a ton of carbon is greater than its private costs.”
a. What is the true cost to society of burning a ton of carbon that is currently not accounted for in the private cost (i.e. social cost of carbon?

WE don't know the true social cost. That is why I followed the observation you noted in my written
testimony with the statement that “agreeing that the [social cost of CO2] is greater than zero isn’t
really agreeing on very much."

Indeed, the total social cost of future C02 output is the important question (even ignoring that
much of past developed-world growth and much of developing world growth stems from
underpriced CO2 externalities). The answer to that question begins embedded in estimates of the.
cost of future global warming associated with man-made CO2 output (including foregone economic
growth from curtailing CO: output). If the effects of CO2 upon global warming are nearer in time
and/or greater in magnitude, the social cost of CO2 is higher. But even scientific estimates vary
considerably in timing and magnitude, leading to estimates anywhere between $5 per ton and $200
per ton. A US government study put the cost at $20 per ton.[2] In truth, nobody knows the “right”
price.

Some economists argue that the social cost of CO2 should be reflective of a worst-case catastrophic
outcomc. While there is some logic to that approach the outcome of such analyses are unhelpful, since in extremis the resulting policy prescription is an infinite price on CO2, so high as to shut down all use altogether. Such reasoning is analogous to requiring banks to hold 100% capital to forestall another financial crisis, resulting in zero bank lending contribution to economic growth. Moreover, the other side of the extreme value distribution is that is not effect — while — while just a remote an outcome — suggests mitigating the prohibitively high policy bucket roughly the average.

Such reasoning is why economists like myself advocatc that if setting up a mechanism to address
CO@ at all, setting up a workable CO: mechanism that can adapt over time to the needs of society.
Such a mechanism is not that of the EU, California, or the RGGI, but a national (if not global)
mechanism that can balance the cost of abatement with the benefit of lower CO2 emissions in order
to respond to outcomes and scientific evidence, as those evolve. This system need not target a
“right” price, but should target a price that —- at least minimally ~ deters CO2 output at the margin.
Current systems are not workable and are not pricing CO@ at a level that even minimally deters
output. The current deterrent to CO2 output — political uncertainty - leads to widely disparate
estimates of carbon costs that, generally inhibits long-term investment in today‘s economy.

2. Several Economists who served Republican Presidents including Henry Paulson (Secretary of the Treasury under President George W. Bush), Arthur Gaffer (economic Advisor under President Reagan), and George Shultz (Secretary of State under President Reagan and Secretary of Labor Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon), here expressed support for placing a price on carbon. In your testimony you stated that “if we want markets to reflect more dramatic outcomes we will have to use a carbon tax.” 

a. What is the best way to structure a carbon fee program? Specifically, please explain the sources that should be covered by the fee programs; point at the fee should be assessed (e.g. at the mine mouth, refinery gate); initial price per metric ton and rationale for selecting that price; rate and frequency at which the price should increase; the greenhouse gases (GHGs) to be covered and if the fee is assessed for GHGs besides carbon dioxide, how GHGs with higher global warming potentials (GWPS) should be treated (e.g. refrigerants with high GWPs); entity or entities that should administer and enforce the program; revenue use; and measures to protect energy intensive trade exposed industries that low-income Americans are not disproportionately affected.  

Related to the response above since we do not know the “right” price of carbon there is no “best"
way to structure a tax on CO2 or other greenhouse gases.

In fact. it could be that even a small tax nowhere near the “best” tax — may have drastic effects on
energy use, obviating the need for the “best" solution. There are myriad examples in economics of
small user fees — well below the economic costs of the activities — changing significantly consumer
and business behavior and reducing disproportionately the magnitude. of undesirable activities, It
could be, therefore, that a small tax on carbon ~ applied to the right segments of the economy v
could have dramatic effects.

That said, we economists know that: the effects of any charges are equivalent to a tax in that they
reduce the targeted economic activity. If those reyenues are used to fund offsetting activities, they
can -— in theory — be neutral to economic growth. In practice, revenues derived from CO2 programs
hate instead been used to pay off prior budget deficits, rendering the taxes a drag on economic
growth.

The last portion of the question —- focusing on “protecting energy-intensive trade exposed
industries and ensuring that low income Americans are not disproportionately affected" —
deserves special attention. Blanket energy subsidies worldwide have been associated with high
energy use. In fact, it has been established that such subsidies benefit the rich much more than the
poor, because the rich use more subsidized energy in response to subsidies, while the demand from
the poor remains relatively inelastic since they are always economizing. Research from the IMF
suggests that the richest 20% get more than 40% o of the benefits from energy subsidies, roughly six
times the share of the bottom 20%[3] Recently, some countries have targeted their energy subsidies
to remove the benefit for the rich and preserve the help for the poor, but that has taken extreme
political courage on the part of those nation’s politicians.[4] Nonetheless, the effect on energy usage
has already been dramatic.

You are likely aware that Germany is now building new coal fired power plants to meet their caseload energy needs. As well, Germany is looking at lifting their ban on hydraulic fracturing so their companies can be more competitive and receive the the feedstock that makes building virtually anything possible. Why is Germany doing this?

Germany is looking back at conventional energy sources because (1) they need sources to replace
the nuclear they are phasing out and (2) their subsidized wind and solar are expensive conventional
alternatives. In 2013 Germany experienced a sharp increase in electricity prices as a result of
€20.4bn in “feed-in” subsidies for green energy" paid for out of consumer electricity bills. In 2013,
the mandatory surcharge electricity rose from 3.6 cents per kWh to a record 5.3 cents per kWh. For
a typical household using 3500 kWh per year, this surcharge rose from €125 to roughly €185

The increase raised consumer’ ire because manv businesses are exempted from the surcharge, in
in order to protect their “international competitiveness.

Such subsidies certainly increased investment in green alternatives, but at the inevitable expense of
higher energy costs.

 But the subsidies have also skewed investment in ways that do not adequately serve Germany’s
energy needs. “there is now so much renewable power available at certain times of day that it meets
a significant part of demand,” but renewables like wind and solar are unreliable. As a result utilities
need to keep conventional sources of electricity generation, such as gas and coal, operational as
back-ups.“

According to Jason Channell, alternative energy and cleantech analyst at Citi, those backups need to
be paid for, too and utilities “expect a capacity payment mechanism from regulators to compensate
them for the low utilisation rates.[7]

These demand shifts have formed over the past several years so much so that they have skewed
long-term investment decisions, According to the financial Times “Demand for coal from power
generators has soared over the past two years as that for cleaner natural gas has shrunk, the reason
being price, In Europe, natural gas is generally sold on contracts linked to the oil price, which is still
relatively strong. Meanwhile, coal usage has been encouraged by low prices for burning carbon
under the EUs carbon-trading scheme as the eurozone crisis has led to a {all in demand [for CO2
permits.] Ample supplies of coal on the back of exports from North America -~ where the shale gas
boom has pushed natural gas prices to lO-year lows this year - have also lowered prices, making coal
much more competitive.”

in short, Germany got caught in a tangled web of subsidies and perverse incentives that are now
actually raising its CO2 output, instead of shrinking it. Again the EU’s cap and trade system and
sovereign subsidies are not working to reduce CO2 output and, in my opinion, do not provide a

2.It is my understanding that youth unemployment in the uK stands at almost 21% reached 26% in France last year, and Spain’s is even worse at over 56%. All the countries promised that their carbon regulations and energy mandates would be a boon to their economies and opportunities for young adults. Unfortunately, the exact opposite is the case. How will the President’s plan to cap energy use impede economic activity and future opportunities for our young adults?

There seems to be a vast disconnect between energy jobs and policy. Wind turbines, solar panels,
and battery storage” are generally not items that: are produced in the U.S. but primarily come from
companies in the Asia/Pacific region. Some companies — particularly those from China — bring in
their own installation and maintenance crews from overseas. again detracting from employment in
such sectors in the US. Thus, employment opportunities have not been found in wind and solar.

There may be jobs in biofuels as loggers cut down forests to fuel European power plants. I would
argue that such gains are fleeting and not green. anyway, so that they do not count to meeting
environmental goals but only stand as perverse remnants of failed CO2 policies.

But the biggest source of jobs associated with lowering CO2 output is unfashionable and
disincentivized in the U.S. If we are to move U.S. power generation to more renewables and lower-
CO2 sources, our energy infrastructure will have to change. But projects like the Keystone Pipeline
remain mired in the same bureaucratic morass as energy policy, overall, while jobs suffer and U.S.
firms cannot take advantage of cheap natural gas as a step toward cleaner energy’ generation.

 As a result, we are moving backward. toward less developed countries as firms “focus on embedded
generation, produced on site where you can control your own energy costs." according to Ben
Warren, energy and environmental infrastructure leader at Ernst & Young.[10] As a result. we “will
still need some form of centralized infrastructure to help provide back—up generation." says Mr. 
Warren.[11] 

But even the jobs involved in building infrastructure are no longer incentivized by an education
policy that tries to send every child to college, whether they are suited for higher education or not
(as well, as a university “industry” that continues to market that message, as well). Our educational
system has deemphasized technical training so much that the demand is partially met by fly-by—night
for-profit “colleges” that do not focus on students’ interests and needs. Some of the successes from
technical employment are described in a recent Wall Street journal article. “This Way Up: Mobility
in America: Economic mobility is alive and well for Americans who pursue technical or practical
training.”

One example used in the article is the welding profession. According to the Wall Street journal,
“The average age in the field is 54, and the American Welding Society predicts openings for more

" Whilc battery storage is “green” from the perspective of CO2, it is not green from the perspective of heavy
metals pollution and ground water. Real green policies would balance clean air and clean water needs by
addressing all sorts of environmental threats.

than 400,000 workers by 2024 — welders and others who need welding skills, such as pipe fitters,
plumbers and boilermakers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs the average wage at $36,300 a year,
but anecdotal evidence suggests that is the low end of what's possible. JV Industrial says that it pays
more like $75,000. with some employees earning more than $100,000. In the Burgeoning shale
industry, in Texas and Appalachia, welders can earn as much as $7,000 a week.”[12] My (late) father
owned a welding school. I learned to weld in my teens. I can say from first—hand experience that the
Wall Street Journal‘s description is entirely correct. But such important lessons seem lost on
Washington.

So while there may be jobs for US. employees in the new clean energy sector, those have yet to be
realized and U.S. education policies AND the proposed new energy policies push them further out
of reach of many Americans.

1. Does raising the cost of energy affect poor people more than it affects wealthy people? Please explain. 

 Yes. The reason is that energy expenditures are not elastic for poor people — they already spend as
little as they can afford on energy whereas others hare a more elastic demand — they can switch to
public transportation or cut out unnecessary transportation or home energy expenditures in
response to higher costs;

As a result, it is widely accepted worldwide that “mitigating measures to protect the poor” are
required in response to rising energy costs, especially when removing energy subsidies to promote
more efficient energy use and higher economic productivity. ”

In the past several years, Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Yemen have
started reforming energy subsidies “by increasing energy prices while mitigating the impact on the
poor. In most cases reforms have been part of a broad-based fiscal strategy to reduce fiscal deficits
and free resources to be put toward social spending and infrastructure—Which could help boost
growth and reduce poverty and inequality.”[14] All such programs have required a scaling up “well—
targeted social safety nets to compensate those who will be hardest hit by higher prices,“[15] The US,
should expect to undertake similar policies if we choose to increase energy costs.

 

2. Is a government mandate requiring business to spend money to clean up the environment, in an economic sense, little different than the government raising taxes and then using that money to carry out the environmental improvements?

Assuming the expenditures are the same — in both magnitude and substance — the only difference
arises from government overhead in administering the taxes and selecting projects and awarding
funds,

That said, neither business nor the government is very good at carrying out environmental
improvements themselves‘ and both should be left to manage their core competencies.

A good example of the government requiring firms to provide products and services outside their
core product area is from banking is the Community Reinvestment Act where all banks were
required to make loans to lower-income consumers. While the goal of providing credit to such
consumers is laudable, not ALL banks are good at that business. After decades of problems,
Regulators and Congress finally acquiesced to that reality and allowed banks to make investments in
lenders who specialized those product segments in order to meet the goals of the regulation.

Thus, inevitably there will be a layer of administration with regard to the environmental projects to
be funded by such levies. It may be best to motivate the economy, itself, to create an industry
serving the demand for such environmental projects[16], rather than expecting disparate businesses to
undertake such projects on their own or adding new layers of government overhead to administer
the distribution of such levies.


[6] In order to foster efficiency in such an industry, one could take a lesson from charities and award greater
credit to those with the most effective outcomes and the lowest overhead costs (in terms of the, amount of
funds contributed that go to administrative overhead versus the core mission of the charity).

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Dr. Mason. 
Let me begin with a question prompted by Administrator 
Ruckelshaus’ testimony. Mr. Ruckelshaus, you described a number 
of environmental improvements that took place on our watch. You 
mentioned that inherent in all was powerful economic interests re-
sisting controls, to use your phrase. 

You said that in all of the cases cited, the solutions to the prob-
lems did not result in the predicted economic and social calamity. 
Each of you has had the firsthand experience of having to make 
decisions that were surrounded by fears and anxieties about per-
haps dire consequences of your decision. Each of you has made that 
decision, each has seen the consequences as they played out in the 
aftermath. 

My question to each of you, starting with Mr. Ruckelshaus whose 
testimony I think probably foretells his answer, how did the worst 
fears and assumptions of bad outcomes from environmental regula-
tions turn out in reality as the rules were applied in your own ex-
perience? Mr. Ruckelshaus? 

Mr. RUCKELSHAUS. Let me mention just one example. The Con-
gress, in 1970, passed the Clean Air Act which provided that in the 
law itself by 1975, the cars would be 95 percent improved in three 
named pollutants in the law—hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and 
nitrogen oxide. 

The claim of the automobile companies was that this was impos-
sible to do by 1975. I think they probably were right about that. 
It was an overly ambitious goal set by the Congress. 

As Administrator, I was authorized to give them a 1-year exten-
sion from the meeting of those 1975 goals if the facts warranted. 
We had extensive hearings and decided, in the first instance, not 
to grant an extension and in the second instance, an extension was 
granted. 

By 1976, with the use of the catalyst, most of the automobile 
companies were on the way to achieving the standards as required 
by the statute. 

The claims during those hearings and during the passage of the 
laws were that the industry was going to collapse. Ford Motor 
Company predicted they would have to shut down their whole com-
pany if this law passed. 

There was enough flexibility in the law, enough chance to give 
them the kind of leeway they needed to achieve the standards. 
Once they saw the rule was serious and we were going to pursue 
as vigorously as we could the achievement of the requirements 
under the law in the rule, then they began to focus on reducing the 
cost. 

The motivation of trying to resist the regulation, resist the law 
that was passed by the Congress, changed from one of claiming the 
end was near to one of let us see if we can do this and do it in 
a cost effective way. 

They did do it in a cost effective way and we achieve the stand-
ards finally. It was later than they expected. There was some lee-
way granted by the Congress after the original law. 
We have almost three times as many cars on the road today and 
the emissions from the automobiles are 95 percent reduced.

Senator WHITEHOUSE. In my remaining minute, let me ask you 
to fill in and if we have a second round, I will come back and finish 
the question with the others but I am running out of time. 

Ms. WHITMAN. Probably the best example I can give is when we 
were working on increasing the efficiency of air conditioners. We 
were being sued by everyone, including the DOE, saying it was ab-
solutely impossible, that this was going to kill the industry. 
We went ahead and found one company that said, no, we can do 
this. Carrier Air Conditioning said they could do it. They did it and 
started producing the more highly efficient air conditioners. Now 
everyone has exceeded those rules. We took them to 11 percent; 
they are now talking about 23 percent ratings. 

The ingenuity in the American system kicked in. The minute 
they knew this was real, it was going to happen not only did we 
not see a loss in jobs or loss in dollars, we saw this whole industry 
achieve new levels that we did not think were possible. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. With my time expired, let me turn to my 
distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Sessions. 

Senator SESSIONS. Thank you. 
We certainly have made some great progress in the air in Amer-
ica and the water is so much cleaner than it has been. When we 
see situations in China, we are proud of what we have accom-
plished. 

However, I would say CO2 is a different kettle of fish. It is not 
particulates and NOx and SOx. It is plant food and it is not a pol-
lutant in any normal definition of it, although Governor Whitman, 
I will acknowledge the Supreme Court by a 5–4 ruling ruled other-
wise based on IPCC data. 

Mr. Chairman, I would offer the letter to Gina McCarthy from 
West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey regarding EPA’s 
asserted authority under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to reg-
ulate CO2 emissions from existing coal fired power plants and a 
white paper from 17 attorneys general and one senior environ-
mental regulator to another State regarding the authority of States 
under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to determine standards 
as applied to individual sources. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Without objection, those documents will be 
made a part of our record.

Re: EPA’s Asserted Authority Under Section 11.1(d) Of The Clean Air Act To
Regulate C02 Emissions From Existing Coal—fired Power Plants

Dear Administrator McCarthy:

On June 2, 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) launched
one of the most far-reaching and expensive regulatory projects in American history: the Carbon
Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units
(“Proposed Rule").] The Proposed Rule seeks to impose limitations on C0; emitted from
existing coal-fired power plants, requiring a staggering 30% reduction in the emissions from
these plants across the country in a more 15 years. West Virginian, a major consumer of coal-
generated electricity and one of the leading producers of coal—-will be uniquely harmed by the
restrictions of the Proposed Rule.

As the chief legal officer for the State of West Virginia, I respectfully request that you
withdraw the Proposed Rule immediately because EPA lacks the legal authority to adopt that
Rule. In the Legal Memorandum for Proposed Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for
Existing Electric Utility Generating Units (“Legal Memorandum” or “Mem,”) that was issued
together with and incorporated by reference into the Proposed Rule,[2] EPA offers only one legal
basis for the Rule: the rarely invoked Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). See 42
U.S.C. § 741 1(d). The problem is that Section 111(d) affirmatively excludes precisely what EPA
is attempting to do in the Proposed Rule.

1 The Rule has not yet been published in the Federal Register and is currently available at
http://wwwz.epa.gov/sites/productioMiles/2014»05/documents/20l40602proposal—cleanpowerplan.pdf.

As this letter explains, EPA lacks authority under the plain text of Section lll(d), as it
appears in the United States Code, to promulgate the Proposed Rule. Section 111(d) expressly
prohibits EPA from regulating “any air pollutant . . . emitted from a[n] [existing] source category
which is regulated under {the national emission regime in Section 112 of the CAA}.” 42
USC. § 7411(d). Given that EPA has imposed extensive and onerous regulations on existing
coal—fired power plants under Section 112, the agency cannot now use Section 111(d) to require
regulation of C02 emissions from those same existing plants. This conclusion is so apparent that
even EPA concedes in its Legal Memorandum that a “literal reading” ofSection 111(d) prohibits
the Proposed Rule. Mom. 26; see also 70 Fed. Reg. 15,994, 16,032 (Mar. 29, 2005) (EPA
making the same admission in a prior rulemaking),

The only textual justification that EPA’s Legal Memorandum offers for departing from
the “literal” terms of Section 111(d) is unpersuasive. The agency relies entirely on a one-
sentence clerical entry in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act that was not codified in the
US. Code but appears in the Statutes at Large. That entry, even EPA has admitted, was clearly a
mistake because it sought to make a technical correction rendered moot by another amendment.
See 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031 (describing the entry as a “drafting error”). Nevertheless, EPA now
claims that it must give meaning to this mistake and, as a result, has announced an interpretation
of Section 111(d) that directly conﬂicts with the language in the US. Code. EPA’s interpretation
rewrites Section 111(d) from a prohibition on the regulation of "any air pollutant . . . emitted
from a source category which is regulated under [Section 1 12],” as stated in the [1.8. Code, to a
more limited prohibition on the regulation of “any hazardous air pollutant” emitted from such a
source category. This sort of reasoning would be wrong under any circumstance, but it is
particularly improper here, where it is being offered as the justification for one of the most costly
regulations in this Nation’s history.

in light of the profound legal infirmities with the Proposed Rule, EPA‘S unprecedented
policy will not survive judicial review. As such, it would be contrary to the public interest to
proceed with publication in the Federal Register. Failure to withdraw the Proposed Rule will
only cause citizens, States, industry, and environmental groups to waste valuable resources
analyzing and commenting on a futile endeavor. Moreover. given the short timeframe for
compliance with the Rule’s objectives, many of these parties will be required to incur significant
and unnecessary costs. This will trigger unwarranted market responses and economic dislocation
from coerced reduction of the use of coal as parties struggle to meet the anticipated requirements.
This is unacceptable. No matter how fervent the desire by some to advance the policies
underlying these regulations, EPA cannon—and should not do so at the expense of the rule of
law.

A. EPA Has Conceded That The Proposed Rule Is Unlawful Under The “Literal”
Terms Of The Clean Air Act

The only authority invoked by EPA for the onerous requirements in the Proposed Rule is
Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, a little-used provision that grants EPA limited power to
require States to regulate air pollutants from existing sources. Mom. 11—12. As it appears in the
US. Code, Section lll(d) requires the EPA Administrator under narrow circumstances to

Page 218

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 3

“prescribe regulations which shall establish a procedure , . . under which each State shall submit
to the Administrator a plan which establishes standards of performance” for certain existing
sources and certain air pollutants. Among other things, the statutory provision specifically
excludes from the Administrator’s authority the power to prescribe regulations relating to
“standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant . . . emitted from a source
category which is regulated under section 7412 of this title 1118., Section 112 of the CAA].” 42
U ,S.C. § 7411(d). EPA admits in its Legal Memorandum for the Proposed Rule that “a literal
reading of that language” means that “EPA c[an] not regulate any air pollutant from a source
category regulated under section 1 12” of the Clean Air Act. Mem. 26 (emphasis added); accord
70 Fed. Reg. at 16,032 (EPA reaching the same conclusion). Simply put, Section 1 11(d)’s plain
text provides that if an existing source category is regulated under Section 112, that source
category may not also be regulated under Section 1 11(d).

The regime codified in Sections 112 and 111 is part of a measured, coherent approach to
regulating air pollutants from new and existing pollution sources. Section 112 01‘ the Clean Air
Act concerns national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants (“HAPs”) emitted from
any number of new and existing sources. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412. Whether a source category is
regulated under Section 112 is generally dependent upon a number of factors. Id §7412(c).
With regard to coal-fired power plants, Congress specially provided that those sources need only
be regulated under Section 112 if the Administrator finds such regulation to be “appropriate and
necessary.” Id. § 7412(n). Section 111(d) in turn addresses the emission of air pollutants emitted
from existing sources not regulated under Section 112. Specifically, when EPA has chosen not
to regulate a source category nationally under Section 112, emissions from existing sources
within that category must be subject instead to state-by-state emission standards under Section
111(d), assuming certain other predicates have been satisfied. The rest of Section 11 l, which is
not at issue here, is not restricted by the scope of Section 112 and concerns national emissions
standards for air pollutants emitted from new sources.

In the present case, it is clear that EPA has no authority under Section 111(d) to regulate
“any” emission from coal—fired power plants, including C02 emissions. EPA categorized coal-
fired power plants as part of a “source category” under Section 112 in 2000, see 65 Fed. Reg.
79,825, 79,826 (Dec. 20, 2000), and the DC. Circuit in 2008 rejected EPA’s attempt to withdraw
that finding, see New Jersey in EPA, 517 F.3d 574 (DC. Cir. 2008). Then, in 2012, EPA
imposed significant Section 112 restrictions on coal-fired power plants. see 77 Fed. Reg. 9,304
(Feb. 16, 2012); 40 C.F.R. Part 63 subpart UUUUU, which the DC. Circuit recently upheld, see
also White Stallion Energy Cm, LLC v. EPA, 1‘ F.3d._, 2014 WL 1420294 (DC. Cir. Apr. 15.
2014). Under the “literal” reading of Section 111(d), Mom. 26, these rules regulating existing
coal-fired power plants under Section 112 prohibit EPA from invoking Section 111(d) to adopt
the Proposed Rule.

B. EPA’s Arguments Based Upon A Clerical “Drafting Error” In The 1990 Clean Air
Act Amendments Cannot Displace The “Literal” Terms Of Section 111(d)

Faced with the unambiguous terms of Section 1 11(d) in the US. Code, EPA falls back in
its Legal Memorandum to an erroneous prior analysis that the agency conducted in 2005, in

Page 219

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 4

which it concluded that Section 111(d) is actually “ambiguous" and therefore subject to the
agency’s “reasonable" interpretation. Mem. 8, 26, That 2005 analysis which was part of a rule
under Section lll(d) that the DC. Circuit vacated in New Jersey v. EPA, 5i 7 F.3d 574—based
its conclusion entirely upon a clerical entry in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act that
was not codified in the US. Code but appears in the Statutes at Large. According to EPA, the
1990 Amendments included two entries relevant to Section 111(d). Both entries appear in the
Statutes at Large, but only the first amendment—described by EPA as the “substantive” one—w
was incorporated into the (5.8. Code. EPA argues that the mere existence of the second, clerical
amendment creates an ambiguity sufficient to call into doubt the language of Section 111(d) in
the US. Code. EPA’s attempt to displace the plain terms of Section lll9d) was wrong in 2005
and remains so today.

1. The Clerical “Drafting Error” In The 1990 CleanAir Act Amendments Does Not
Create An Ambiguity In The Terms Q/‘Section I 1 Md)

As a threshold matter, EPA’s analysis is wrong because the one-sentence clerical entry
referred to by EPA falls far short of the showing necessary to cast doubt on the plain terms of
Section 111(d) as they appear in the US. Code. The “Code of Laws of the United States current
at any time shall . , . establish prima facie the laws of the United States.” 1 U.S.C. § 204(a). As
“prima facie“ evidence, the language of Section 111(d) in the US Code is displaced only where
the US. Code is “inconsistent” with the Statutes at Large. See Stephan v. United States, 319
US. 423, 426 (1943). There is no inconsistency here.

A review of the two relevant entries in the Statutes at Large reveals that the clerical entry
does not create an ambiguity or inconsistency, but rather is—A-as even EPA has admitted—a
“drafting error [that] should not be considered.” 70 Fed, Reg. at 16,031.

The first relevant entry appears in the Statutes at Large among a list of other entries
making substantive amendments to Section ill. Prior to these amendments in 1990, Section
1 1 ltd) had prohibited EPA from requiring state—by-state regulation of any air pollutant on the list
of HAPs published under Section llZ(b)(l)(A). This particular amendment made a significant
substantive change by replacing the reference to “l l2(b)(l)(A)" with the language that now
appears in the US. Code-“emitted from a source category which is regulated under section
llZ." Pub. L. No. 101-549, § 108(g), 104 Stat. 2399, 2467 (1990). As a result, the restriction in
Section 11 l(d) changed from one focused on HAPs regulated under Section H2 to one focused
instead on source categories regulated under that section.

The second relevant entry appears much later in the Statutes at Large among a list of
purely clerical changes — entitled “Conforming Amendments." Pub. L, No. 101-549, §302(a),
104 Stat, 2399, 2474 (1990). As explained in the Senate‘s Legislative Drafting Manual,
"Conforming Amendments” are “amendments of a provision of law that [are] necessitated by
the substantive amendments or provisions of the bill.” Senate Legislative Drafting Manual
§ l26(b)(2)(A). They effectuate the sorts of ministerial changes required to clean up a statute
after it has been substantively amended. Thus, conforming amendments “include[] amendments,

Page 220

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 5

such as amendments to the table of contents, that formerly may have been designated as clerical
amendments." Id

Consistent with its description as a conforming amendment, this particular entry sought
simply to bring up to date the cross-reference in Section 111(d) to Section 1 12(b)(1)(A). Other
amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990 had eliminated Section 112(b)(l)(A) entirely and
replaced it with Sections 112(b)(1), 112(b)(2), and 112(b)(3). This clerical amendment was
designed solely to account for those changes. Specifically, it provided that “Section 111(d)(1) of
the Clean Air Act is amended by striking ‘[l 12](b)(1)(A)’ and inserting in lieu thereof
‘[112](b).’” Pub. L. No. 101-549, § 302(3). Unlike the substantive amendment described above,
this non—substantive amendment would not have changed the restriction in Section 111(d) from
its pre-l990 focus on hazardous air pollutants regulated under Section 1 12.

In light of the substantive amendment, however, the second non-substantive amendment
was clearly an unnecessary mistake or, as EPA has put it, a “drafting error.” When the
conforming amendment is applied after the substantive amendment, as is required by the very
nature of conforming amendments, there is no clerical correction left to make because the cross—
reference to 112(b)(1)(A) has already been removed by the substantive amendment. This is
consistent with the codifier's notation in the US. Code that the clerical amendment "could not be
executed.” Revisor’s Note, 42 U.S.C. § 7411. Where a conforming amendment is entirely
unnecessary, it is rightly understood as a clerical mistake that need not be given any effect, See
Am, Petroleum Ins]. 1!. SEC, 714 F.3d 1329, 1336-37 (DC. Cir. 2013).

EPA has correctly recognized as much—noting in 2005, for example, that the clerical
entry “is a drafting error and therefore should not be considered”~—but it then wrongly
determined that it nevertheless “must attempt to give effect to both the [substantive] and
[clerical] [entries], as they are both part of the current law." 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031; accord
Mem. 21 (recognizing “apparent drafting errors during enactment of the 1990 CAA
Amendments”). This fundamental ﬂaw dooms EPA’s analysis. As the DC. Circuit recently
explained, where a mistake in renumbering a statute and correcting a cross-reference conflicts
with substantive provisions of that statute, the mistake should be considered most likely “the
result of a scrivener’s errorﬂ“ and should not be treated as “creating an ambiguity." Am.
Petroleum, 714 F.3d at 1336-37. Under this reasoning, it is clear that the clerical entry simply
“should not be considered," as EPA originally concluded. 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031. At the very
minimum, the existence of such a non—substantive. “drafting error” is not enough to overcome
the fact that language codified in the U.S. Code is "prima facie” evidence of “the laws of the
United States.” 1 U.S.C. §204(a).

Put another way. EPA now asserts that the non-substantive and substantive
amendments—if each were implemented into Section 111(d)’s prior text standing alone—would
create two separate versions of Section 111(d), Mom, 24. The first version incorporates only the
non-substantive amendment and therefore retains the pro-1990 prohibition on regulating HAPS
under Section 111(d), regardless of whether the source category emitting those HAPs is
regulated under Section 112. The second version is the one that actually appears in the U.S.

Code and substantively changes the prohibition to forbidding EPA from regulating under Section
111(d) any air pollutants emitted by any existing source regulated under Section 112. Mem. 24.

But this approach of treating both amendments as, in effect, creating two different
version of l 11(d) directly contradicts EPA’S concession that the inclusion of the non-substantive
entry in the Statutes at Large was merely a clerical “drafting error.” Critically, the only evidence
EPA may use in its attempt to rebut the terms of Section 111(d) as expressed in the U .8. Code is
the Statutes at Large, see Stephan, 319 US. at 426, and the Statutes at Large simply do not
re act two separate versions of Section 111(d). Rather. they reflect only two amendments~one
a substantive change and one a mere clerical entry—~and the clerical entry is rendered moot by
the substantive amendment.3

2. EPA ‘5' Policy Arguments Cream No Ambiguity In Section 111(d)

EPA’s policy arguments against the “literal” terms of Section lll(d) also cannot
generate an ambiguity where none exists in the plain statutory text. As a threshold matter, even
if EPA were correct that the “literal" terms of Section 111(d) produce overly harsh results for
EPA’S regulatory authority, EPA may not “redraft a statute in order to avoid what
the agency characterized as the ‘absurd results‘ that would ﬂow from the statute’s language”
where it is, as here, “‘not inconceivable that Congress meant what the statute says?” Ass'n of
Am. RRS. v. Surface Tramp. 8d, 162 F.3d 101, 105 (DC. Cir. 1998) (quoting Mova
Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Shalala. l40 F.3d 1060. 1072 (DC. Cir. 1998)). In any event, EPA’S
policy arguments miss the mark because the “literal” terms of Section 111(d) are part of a
rational regulatory scheme.

This regime quite logically avoids subjecting existing sources to both new national
standards for hazardous pollutants under Section 112 as well as new state-by—state standards
under Section 111, while permitting regulation under both Section 111 and Section 112 of new
sources. Unlike with new sources, the imposition of additional regulatory burdens on existing
sources raises questions of fairness and lost investments, as existing sources that were built under
a different regulatory regime may or may not have the technological or financial ability to come
into compliance with two sets of new rules. Indeed, both Sections 1 12 and l 1 1(d) recognize that
the cost of compliance must be weighed against maximum achievable reductions. See 42 U.S.C.

3 Although some had argued in 2005 and 2008 that the clerical entry should take precedence over the substantive
entry, EPA repeatedly and properly rejected those arguments as having “no merit.“ final Brief of Respondent EPA.
New Jersey v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574 (DC. Cir. 2008), 2007 W1, 2155494. at *103 n.33; accord 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031-
32. For example, the agency has explained that the so-called “last in point of arrangement“ rule of statutory
construction "is inapplicable here, as it applies to discrete sections of the same Act, not competing amendments to
the same section of an Act, as is the case here.” 2007 W1, 2155494, at ‘5103 n.33. Indeed, EPA emphaticallv
declared that it is “hard to conceive“ that Congress would have intended to give effect to the clerical change over the
substantive change, because, among other things, only the substantive change gives meaning to Section
112(n)(l)(A), which was also adopted during the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act. Section 112(n)(l)(A)
required EPA to conduct a study to determine whether coal-fired power plants “should even be regulated under
section 1 12." 70 Fed. Reg. at 15,995. As EPA recognized, this provision is strong evidence that Congress did not
wish to subject such power plants to “duplicative or overlapping regulation." but rather sought to force EPA to
choose between regulating power plants as a source category under Section l12 or 111(d). consistent with the
substantive change and not the clerical one. Id. at 16,031.

Page 222

The Honorable Gina McCarthy

Page 7

§§ 7411(a)(1), 741 1(d), 7412(d). in establishing this regime, under which regulation of existing
sources occurs either under Section 112 or Section 111(d), Congress properly determined that
requiring the same existing source categories to comply with two functionally—independent
regulatory regimes would threaten these sources’ economic viability. Indeed, EPA has recently
imposed costly regulations on coal~fired power plants, which will cost those plants more than $9
billion dollars per year. See EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis for the final Mercury and Air
Toxics Standards at 3-13 (Dec. 2011), available at http://www.epa.gov/mt/ecas/regdata/RIAS
/matsriafinal.pdf‘, EPA’s Proposed Rule would subject those same plants to billions of dollars of
additional costs, through the imposition of duplicative regulatory requirements, forcing many of
those plants to close. That is the exact scenario Congress intended to avoid when it amended
Section 111(d).

in light of this understanding, EPA’s policy arguments in favor of ignoring Section
111(d)’s plain language are insubstantial.

EPA first claims that a “literal reading” of Section 111(d) would be contrary to
“Congress’ desire in the 1990 CAA Amendments to require EPA to regulate more substances.”
Mem. 25-26. But the mere fact that one of the broad purposes behind the 1990 Amendments
was to require EPA to regulate more substances under Section 112 does not mean that Congress
was not cognizant of other values, such as the need to avoid costly double regulation. In fact—
as EPA itself admitted in its 2005 analysis — the text, structure, and history of the 1990
Amendments indicates a desire by Congress to limit EPA’s ability to doubly regulate coal-fired
power plants, As explained above, the discussion and ultimate adoption of Section 112(n)(l)(A)
“reveals” that Congress did not want to subject coal—fired power plants to “duplicative or
otherwise inefficient regulation” 70 Fed. Reg. at 15,999. It is perfectly reasonable to understand
Section 111(d) as seeking to forward this same general goal of avoiding duplicative regulation.

EPA’s other policy argument is “the fact that the EPA has historically regulated non—
HAPs under section 111(d), even where those air pollutants were emitted from a source category
actually regulated under section 112.” Mem. 26. But it is no answer to the unambiguous textual
requirement in the 1990 Amendments to point to EPA‘s pre-amendmemnt practice of regulating
non—l'lAPs under Section 111(0). EPA at one time enjoyed the power of regulating existing
source categories on separate regulatory tracks. See Mcm. 9-10 & n. 17. When Congress
amended the Clean Air Act in 1990 to require EPA to regulate more HAP’s under Section 112,
however, Congress sensibly paired that increased power with a textual limitation—embodied in
Section 111(d}—against using that enhanced authority to impose duplicative regulations on the
same existing source categories. EPA’s argument that the “literal" terms of Section 111(d)
would hamstring it from using a provision that it has only used to regulate “four pollutants from
live source categories” in “forty years," Mem. 9, cannot possibly provide a basis for disregarding
the literal terms of the Clean Air Act.

3. EPA's Attempt To Resolve The Supposed Ambiguity Is Nevertheless
Impermissible

Even if the clerical error created an ambiguity in Section lll(d)’s “literal” text, EPA’s
analysis would still fail. To begin with, the agency’s claim to some unidentified form of
“deference“ for its attempt to rewrite Section lll(d) is meritless. Mem. 12. Courts defer to
agencies under the test set forth in Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc, 467 U .S. 837 (1984), because there is reason to believe that when Congress “left ambiguity
in a statute,” it “understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the
agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion
the ambiguity allows." Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), NA, 517 U .S. 735, 740—741 (1996).
EPA could not possibly argue that Congress intended EPA to resolve the import of Congress’s
inadvertent clerical “drafting error.” Indeed, EPA does not so argue. EPA offers no justification
whatsoever for its bald assertion that it is entitled to deference on this issue, and does not even
cite to Chevron in its discussion of the issue.

In any event, EPA could not possibly prevail under Chevron—fir some other similar form
of deference—because it offers an “impermissible construction” of the supposedly ambiguous
statute. Aid Ass'n for Lutherans v. US. Postal Serra, 321 F.3d 1166, 1178 (DC. Cir. 2003).
EPA would interpret Section 111(d) as follows: "Where a source category is regulated under
section 112, a section 111(d) standard of performance cannot be established to address any HAPS
listed under section 112(1)) that may be entitled from that particular source category.” Mem. 26.
This is flatly inconsistent with the substantive provision, embodied in the US, Code, that EPA
may not “establish“ standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant . . .
emitted from a source category which is regulated under [Section 112 of the CAM.” 42
U.S.C. § 741 Md) (emphasis added). EPA’s proffered interpretation effectively replaces the term
“any air pollutant" with the term “hazardous air pollutant." Even under Chevron, an agency is
not entitled to deference when its interpretation is so “manifestly contrary to the statute.” Mayo
Found. for Med. Educ. & Research v. United States, 131 S. Ct. 704, 711 (2011) (internal
quotations omitted); accord Peril v. US. Dep’t of Educ., 675 F.3d 769, 785 (DC. Cir. 2012).

If EPA wanted to give effect to its view of both the substantive and the clerical entries in
the Statutes at Large—which, as explained above, EPA nonsensically claims create two versions
of Section 111(d}-without impermissibly changing the text of either, it could have done so. As
one commentator has explained, all of EPA’s textual concerns could be satisfied by interpreting
Section 111(d) to prohibit the regulation of “any air pollutant . . . which is not included on a list
published under .. .112(b) [revision of the prior version of Section lll(d) after inputting the
clerical entry] or emitted from a source category which is regulated under section 1 12 [revision
of the prior version of Section 111(d) after inputting the substantive entry].” William J. Haun,
The Clean Air Act as an Obstacle to the Environmental Protection Agency is Anticipated Attempt
to Regulate Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Power Plants, 14 Engage: J. Federalist
Soc’y Prac. Groups 35, 38 (Mar. 2013) (parentheticals revised). EPA does not — and could not——
dispute that this is the only interpretation that gives full effect and meaning to every word of both
“versions" of Section 111(d) that it believes the Statutes at Large embodies. Accordingly. to the
extent EPA continues to reject the position that the non-substantive entry must be discarded as an

Page 224

Page 9

inadvertent “scrivener‘s errorﬂ," see Am. Petroleum, 714 F.3d at 1337, the agency is duty-bound
to adopt this alternative interpretation.

EPA’s refusal to advance or acknowledge this alternative is unsurprising, of course,
because under this approach the Proposed Rule would still be unlawful. Under this alternative
interpretation, EPA would be prohibited from using Section 111(d) both: (1) to require regulation
of any HAP listed in Section 112(b), regardless of whether the HAP is being emitted from a
source regulated under Section 112; and (2) to require regulation of (my pollutant emitted from a
source category that is regulated under Section 112, Even under this alternative reading, EPA
still cannot rely on Section 111(d) as a basis for the Proposed Rule because of the regulatory
scheme established under Section 112.[4]

EPA has fundamentally erred in relying upon the ﬂawed reasoning in the vacated 2005
rule to justify the Proposed Rule. It is simply unconscionable for EPA to go forward with this
massive and costly regulation based entirely upon what it has admitted to be a clerical “drafting
error." I urge you to withdraw the Proposed Rule immediately and avoid needless litigation.

Sincerely,

Patrick Morrisey
Attorney General of West Virginia

Re: EPA Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Existing Electric
Generating Units

Dear Administrator McCarthy:

The Attorneys General of seventeen states and the senior environmental regulator of an
eighteenth have followed with interest EPA’s statements regarding its intention to promulgate
guidelines for performance standards for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from existing electric
generating units (EGUs).

We recognize EPA’s obligation to promulgate these guidelines through an open and transparent
process, which would include input from all stakeholders As the statutory responsibility and
authority under Section 111(d) for developing and implementing performance standards is vested
at the state level, we intend to participate fully in this process as representatives for our States.

Enclosed with this letter is a white paper setting forth our position on both EPA and the states’
authority under Section 111(d). The white paper responds to EPA's aggressive proposal for
GHG performance standards for new 136 Us and indications of a similarly aggressive stance on
existing EGUS. Our concerns are justified given EPA'S unwillingness to appropriately defer to
State authority under the Clean Air Act in recent years.


Page 226

Ms. McCarthy
Page Two
Septamber 11, 2013

As the white paper describes, Section 111(d) is unambiguous in granting to states the sole
authority to determine actua1 substantive standards as applied to individual sources. EPA’s role
is limited to establishing procedures whereby states develop and implement performance
standards for existing EGUs. We trust EPA will to adhere to the limitations of its authority
under the Clean Air Act when adopting guidelines for the states' development of plans for GHG
performance standards for existing EGUS.

We appreciate your consideration of our position and restate our cpmmitment to cooperative
federalism as required under the CAA.

Sincerely,

Jon Bruning
Attorney General

Perspective of 18 States on Greenhouse Gas Emission Performance Standards
for Existing Sources under 1119(d) Clean Air Act;

Introduction

As State Attorneys General, we believe it is critical to bring public awareness to another example of what has unfortunately become routine: the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA" or "Agency") is poised to: yet again propose new regulations that venture well beyond the limits of the agency's authority. The President has called upon EPA to propose greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards, regulations, or guidelines for existing power plants by June 1, 2014 and to finalize those rules by June 2015. As this paper will show, EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act is limited to developing a procedure for states to establish emissions standards for. existing sources.: EPA, if unchecked, will continue to implement regulations which far exceed its statutory authority to the detriment of the States, in whom Congress has vested authority under the Clean Air Act, and whose citizenry and industries will ultimately pay the price of these costly and ineffective regulations

Last year, EPA published a proposed rule regulating carbon dioxide ("CO2") emissions from new electric utility generating units ("EGUs"), 77 Fed. Reg. 22,392 (April 13, 2012) (EGU NSPS). In light of recent comments from industry, EPA is considering the need to re propose this standard due to its failure to finalize the action within the CAA's 1 year timeframe In addition, on April. 15 and 17, 2013. some states and environmental groups filed 60- and 180 day Notices of Intent to sue EPA under section 3040a) of the Clean Air Act CAA") for failure to perform the allegedly non-discretionary duty of and/or unreasonably delaying finalizing the 

Page 228

EGU NSPS and proposing standards for existing EGUs.' In response to these Notices a coalition of Attorneys General has requested to be involved in any settlement discussions with advocates of broad federal GHG regulations.

EPA states that once it has issued regulations for an air pollutant from new sources in a particular source category under the CAA l li(b), it has legal authority to regulate emissions from existing sources of that air pollutant within the same source category.” The final version of the new source performance standards for new EGUs will likely face legal challenge. However the following analysis assumes the final EGUNSPs for GHG emissions is upheld and EPA moves forward with rulemaking for existing sources.

The purpose of this paper is to identify a timely example of a serious, ongoing problem in environmental regulation: the tendency of EPA to seek to expand the scope of its jurisdiction at the cost of relegating the role of the States to merely implementing whatever Washington prescribes, regardless of its wisdom, cost, or efficiency in light of local circumstances. The issue is not new. The States and EPA have been at odds over the scope of their respective responsibilities under the federal environmental statutes since the statutes' inception. The recent increase in the level of federal regulatory activity under the Clean Air Act has generated
increase: in the level of federal regulatory activity under the Clean Air Act has generated a

i a settlement agreement entered into by a number of states and environmental groups in December 2010 set forth deadlines for EPA to issue regulations with respect to GHG emissions from existing EGUs. See, 75 Fed. Reg 82.392 (Dec. 20, 2010). The deadlines have passed.

3 The authority of EPA to promulgate GHG NSPS for existing EGUs, even if it finalizes its proposed GHG NSPS rule for new EGUs, has been questioned, See William J. Hann, The Clean Air Act as an obstacle to the Environmental Protection Agency's Anticipated Attempt to Regulate Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Power Plants. THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY (Mar. 2013 available at p://www.fed-soc org publications de ncys anticipated attempt lo-regulate-greenhouse clean-air-act-as-an-obstacle-to-the-environmental protection-age gas emissions from existing power-plants. Without conceding that EPA does have authority to promulgate a GHG NSPS for existing EGUs. we assume for purposes of discussion here that EPA does have that authority and will exercise it.

Page 229

corresponding increase in concerns among the States regarding the preservation of their role in environmental protection. 

The way in which EPA has "pushed the envelope" in interpreting its legal authority under the CAA to promulgate a New Source Performance Standard for new ECUs portends. a similarly aggressive and unlawful approach to the regulation of existing EGUs. EPA's clear policy goal in establishing its new source standards is to prevent the construction. of new coal plants. EPA's proposed EGU NSPS would foreclose the construction of new coal-based electric generation absent carbon capture and storage ("CCS"), yet CCS is likely to remain commercially infeasible for a decade or more. The elimination of coal as a fuel for new electric generation would have highly concerning implications for electricity prices and for the economy and job-creation in general, as well as the competitiveness of American manufacturing. 

In order to justify its proposed standard that would not allow new coal-based EGUs absent CCS, EPA has taken unprecedented steps. The Agency proposed to combine coal and combined cycle natural-gas units into a single regulatory category, something it has never done before for coal and gas EGUs. Indeed, it did not even go so far as recently as last year when it proposed NSPS for traditional pollutants. emitted by EGUs. EPA's aggressive posture in its proposed new source NSPS, both as to foreclosing new coal plants and in pushing the scope of its claimed legal authority, raises serious questions as to the approach EPA will eventually take when it promulgates existing-source NSPS 

If EPA proceeds against existing coal plants with the same hostility, it is likely to be reversed in court. As this paper shows, EPA does not have authority to promulgate prescriptive limitations for existing coal-fueled EGUs. Under section III(d) of the CAA, EPA must recognize that States have broad discretion to determine the nature of NSPS requirements for 


Page 230

existing ECUS, EPA may require States to adopt standards, and EPA may guide how States do so procedurally, but the States are vested with the legal authority to decide the ultimate standards.

The Statutory and Regulatory. Framework For Developing Performance Standards For Existing Sources

The focus of the following analysis is the limitations Congress placed on EPA's authority under Section ill(d) of the CAA. Section ill (d) provides EPA with the authority to develop standards of performance for existing sources and directs the Agency to: 

prescribe relations, which shall establish a procedure similar to that provided by section 7410 of this title under which each State shall submit to the Administrator a plan. which establishes standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant.. to which a standard of performance under this section would apply if such existing source were a new source.

Section 111 (d) requires the existence of a performance standard for new sources as a condition precedent to the development of such standards for existing sources. Thus, the legality of the final version of EPAs EGU NSPS rule has significant implications for EPA's ability to require regulation of existing EGUs.

Most importantly, section 111(d) invokes the principle of cooperative federalism with roles clearly delineated for both EPA and the States. The reference to S l 10 refers to the general process by which States submit their State Implementation Plans SIPs for EPA review Accordingly, EPA's authority under S III (d) is limited to establishing, in the statute's term. a "procedure" by which the States submit plans for regulating existing sources. EPA cannot promulgate rules establishing the substantive standards to be imposed on existing sources. 

The cooperative federalism is illustrated by EPA's general procedural regulations relating to the States'. adoption and submittal of plans establishing standards. of performance for existing.

Page 231

sources. Those regulations require EPA to issue a "guideline document' concurrently with, or after, the "proposal of standards of performance for the control of a designated pollutant from affected facilities." 40 C.F.R. S 60.22(a). The content of the guideline document is of great importance to the preservation of the States role in the development of performance standards for existing sources.

Under EPA's regulations, the guideline document is to provide information for the development of State plans" including a "description of systems of emissions reduction which, in the judgment of the Administrator, have been adequately demonstrated." Id at (b)(2). The guideline document also shall contain an "emission guideline" providing "criteria for judging the adequacy" of S 111(d) plans. 40 C.F.R. S 60.22(b)(5); see, 40 Fed. Reg. 53,341 (Nov. 17, 1975). The emission guideline reflects the application of the best system of emission reduction (considering the cost of such reduction) that has been adequately demonstrated," 40 C.F.R. S 60.22(b)(5). The emission guideline must also allow sub-categorization "when costs of control. physical limitations, geographical location, or similar factors make lit appropriate." Id.

Also under EPA's regulations, the States have nine months. to submit a plan for the control of the designated pollutant to which the guideline document applies," 40 C.F.R. .S 60.23(a)( l). The plan shall include emission standards" that "shall prescribe allowable rates of emissions except when it is clearly impracticable." 40 C.F.R. S 60.24(a), (b)(l). The States have significant discretion in formulating these plans. Although the "emission standards" are to be no less stringent than the corresponding emission guideline(s), the States may make a case-by case determination that a specific facility or class of facilities should be subject to a less-stringent standard or longer compliance schedule due to I) cost of control: 2) physical limitation of installing necessary control. equipment; and 3) other factors making the less-stringent standard ”

Page 232

more reasonable. See, 40 C.F.R. S 60.24 (c), (D. EPA then has four months to determine whether the plan meets the requirements discussed above, If EPA disapproves the plan, the State may correct the deficiencies or, under EPA's construction, the Agency may issue its own plan within 6 months of the original submission deadline See, 10 C.FR. S 60.27(c), (d)

Although these regulations have never been tested in court, EPA undoubtedly has power to adopt procedural regulations governing State adoption of plans setting forth performance standards. But, importantly, and consistent with the statute, the determination of the actual substantive standards is left to the state

Existing Source Performance Standards for CO2 Emissions from EGUs

In contemplating regulation of existing EGUs, however, EPA appears poised to go beyond the establishment of procedures and usurp the states' authority by setting minimum substantive requirements for state performance standards. Having reviewed the statutory and regulatory requirements for developing standards of performance for existing sources. in a general sense, we now apply that legal framework to CO2 emissions from EGUs. Although EPA has not yet issued a proposed guideline document for Co2 emissions from existing EGUs. we offer general observations about potential issues that have already presented themselves

III as well as EPA's own regulations, require that emission Fundamentally, S (d), reductions be made through adequately demonstrated systems of emission reduction technology under S III (d), EPA establishes procedures for States to submit plans containing "performance Performance standards" is defined in S III (a): "The term. standard of standards performance' means a standard for emissions of air pollutants which reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction and any nonair quality health and

Page 233

environmental impact and energy requirements) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated." (Emphasis supplied). And EPA's guideline document and the emission guideline contained therein are to "reflect[] the application of the best system of emission reduction (considering the cost of such reduction) that has been adequately demonstrated 40 C.F.R. § 60.22(b)(5); see also, 42 U.S.C. S 74II(1) (definition of "standard of performance The crux of this requirement thus is that the system be, in fact, adequately demonstrated

It seems incontrovertible that no post-combustion reduction system has been "adequately demonstrated" for CO2 emissions from EGUs on a broad, commercial scale. A system of carbon capture and storage is perhaps a decade away from being technologically and economically feasible. A permitting system for storing CO2 emissions underground and set of legal rules governing liability for CO2 storage has not been put in place in most states. Without an adequately demonstrated post-combustion control technology, EPA must look to standards based on cost-effective efficiency improvements at electric generating units, because more efficient units will produce lower CO2 emissions per unit of heat input or electricity output 

EPA and others may believe that efficiency measures will not ensure the amount of CO2 emission reductions they desire. As a result. some groups have proposed EPA be given flexibility to develop emission guidelines based on trading programs with statewide emissions caps, increased reliance on lower CO2, emitting facilities, or demand-side. and non-regulated source reductions. In short, EPA may attempt to force coal-fueled EGUs to decrease operation time or retire early, or force utilities to rely more heavily on natural gas and other resources in an effort to ensure greater CO2 emission reductions. Such proposals, often offered as ways. of providing "flexibility," do not conform to the limitations Congress has placed on EPA in the 

Page 234

Clean Air Act, nor do they properly preserve the primary role of States in the development of standards of performance for existing sources. Under § lll (d) it is the States, not EPA, that are authorized to adopt performance standards: therefore it is the States, not EPA, that weigh the S li(a)(1) factors to determine what technology is adequately demonstrated. Simply put, EPA lacks statutory authority (and is limited by its own regulations) to issue emission guidelines seeking reductions of CO2 emissions from coal-based EGUs in a manner based on something other than an adequately demonstrated reduction system for such EGUs 

To the extent S 111(d) provides authority for flexible approaches to establishing performance standards to seek reductions in CO2 emissions, that authority is vested in States, not EPA. And of course, under l 16, States retain authority to adopt more stringent CO2 controls than EPA has the authority to mandate 

As noted, § I 111(d) specifies that EPA's regulatory authority is limited to developing a procedure for the submission of state plans. EPA's general regulations authorizing the issuance of emission guidelines that establish minimum requirements, depending on how EPA implements this guideline authority in a particular case, bear on substantive standard-setting But EPA does not have the authority to establish minimum substantive requirements 

EPA cannot dictate substantive outcomes. The agency can require that States actually adopt performance standards based on application of the § 111 (a)(l) factors 

States are additionally afforded the discretion to consider "among other factors, the remaining useful life of the existing source to which such standard applies" when developing performance standards for existing units. Beyond this. Silt(d) does not provide authority for EPA to reject a State plan if it does not contain a standard of performance as that term is defined, and based on the factors set forth, in § Il 1(a)(I)
 

Page 235

In sum, the CAA imposes responsibility for air pollution control at the State and local levels because of the proximity to existing sources. and familiarity with local operating conditions. State implementation plans are thus the primary architecture of emission controls See. §§ 107(a); 110(a): 111(d). The "structure of the CAA militates against reading an extra- statutory requirement into the Act's limitations on state discretion, Because the states enjoy wide discretion' in implementing the Act, the imposition of newfound restrictions upsets the Act's careful. balance between state and federal authority, Union Elec.

Conclusion 

The prospect for EPA adoption of GHG performance standards for new or existing coal- based EGUs raises serious concerns. EPA's aggressive standards for new coal-based EGUs indicate a similarly aggressive approach to existing coal-based EGUs. While EPA is authorized to require States to submit plans containing performance standards, EPA may not dictate what those performance standards shall be. Nor may EPA require States to adopt GHG performance standards that are not based on adequately demonstrated technology or that mandate, in the guise of "flexible approaches." the retirement or reduced operation of still-viable coal-based EGUs. 

These concerns are serious. EPA regulations may harm the nascent economic recovery Moreover, our federalist system of government, as implicated in the CAA, requires that EPA

recognize the rights and prerogatives of States. The extent and form of greenhouse gas regulation is important to the States; it is critical that States be allowed to play their proper roles in making the significant policy judgments that are required in adopting any such regulation.

Senator SESSIONS. Thank you. 
The President, on November 14, 2012, said, ‘‘The temperature 
around the globe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 
years ago.’’ Then on May 29, 2013, he said, ‘‘We also know that the 
climate is warming faster than anybody anticipated five or 10 years 
ago.’‘ 
I want to ask each of our former Administrators if any of you 
agree that is an accurate statement on the climate? If you do, raise 
your hand. Thank you. The record will reflect no one raised their 
hands. 
One of the things Dr. Botkin mentioned was this is difficult when 
we have assertions repeated that are not established by the facts. 
The same is true about hurricanes. If you count the number of Cat-
egory 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 hurricanes each year, this is not a matter of 
dispute, we don’t have more. The IPCC acknowledges that. 
Yet we have the President and top officials repeating that as a 
justification to hammer the coal industry and driving up costs in 
our Country. 
Attorney General Strange, I had a question I wanted to ask of 
you. I appreciate your appearance and your fine leadership in the 
State. 
The four EPA Administrators today say we need to act now. 
Would you also say it is important that we act according to the law 
and do you believe EPA’s proposed existing power plan guidelines 
are consistent with the law? 
Mr. STRANGE. That really is why I am here, not to debate the 
science or the policy. That is a matter for the scientists and for the 
members of this committee and members of the U.S. Senate. 
My concern is whatever decision EPA makes and whatever policy 
it decides to implement that it follow the law. I think they failed 
to do that in this case. I appreciate your introducing for the record 
the letter from my colleague, Patrick Morrissey, the Attorney Gen-
eral of West Virginia which goes into great detail on the legal infir-
mities of this proposal as well as the letter from the 17 other AGs, 
bipartisan group of attorneys around the Country who feel the 
same way. 
Our role is to make sure that whatever the EPA comes up with 
that it follows the law, respects the State’s role in working to 
achieve the type of environmental regulation the Country decides 
it wants to have. That is the lane I am in, that is the oath I took 
and that is the reason I am here today. 
Senator SESSIONS. Our staff has done a study on the federalism 
aspects of EPA. The Clean Air Act establishes a cooperative fed-
eralism between States and EPA. Do you think the proposed exist-
ing power plan guidelines adhere to the Clean Air Act’s process? 
Mr. STRANGE. I do not think so, Senator. In a nutshell, I think 
what the EPA is attempting to do in this case is to regulate at the 
Federal level, removing almost all the discretion that would nor-
mally reside in the States. 
In my experience, maybe it was your experience as Attorney 
General when you preceded me, regulators like to regulate and it 
is an important role that we attorneys general play to ensure that 
when they decide to regulate, they stay within the bounds of their 
authority.

Oftentimes, if you are a regulator and see a problem or perceived 
problem, you want to regulate and at least in my experience, you 
naturally try to exert as much authority as you think is there and 
perhaps more. We think that is what is occurring in this case. 
That is why it is so important not only to me in Alabama but 
to attorneys general across the Country. 

Senator WHITESTONE. We will turn now to Senator Boxer for 
questions. Chairman Boxer, I should say in this room. 

Senator BOXER. Thank you so much. 
I am going to go rapid fire. 

Dr. Mason, when you talk you so remind me of the alarmist that 
we heard both in the 1970’s and the 1990’s over the Clean Air Act. 
Coming from a State that is undergoing a boom in clean energy 
jobs, I am here to say I am going to send you some of the stats 
that Hon. Christine Todd Whitman put out because I want to know 
if you think they are incorrect. 

From 1980 to 2012, the total emissions in the U.S. of six common 
air pollutants dropped by 67 percent, our population grew by 38 
percent, our energy consumption increased by 27 percent, and our 
GDP more than doubled. I checked and this is my statistic that 
jobs increased 88 percent. 

I am going to send that to you for your commentary because 
again, we have always heard this every time there is an initiative. 
It always turns out to be completely wrong. The alarmists are 
wrong. 

I also want to ask our four EPA folks to tell me if they agree 
with this. Senator Sessions and I have a disagreement. He is my 
friend and we respect each other. We have a disagreement on car-
bon. He says this is not a pollutant that hurts you but there is an 
endangerment finding. It was started under George W. Bush and 
completed under Barack Obama. 

Then there as a National Climate Assessment which was re-
quired by law every 4 years. Republicans voted for that 100–0 on 
February 6, 1990. This particular assessment calls out the dangers 
of carbon pollution and says it is going to increase ozone, increase 
asthma, increase hospital admissions, quoting directly, ‘‘Climate 
change is projected to harm human health by increasing ground 
level ozone.’’ 

They specifically cite more carbon pollution as increasing global 
temperatures, increasing premature deaths and worsened ozone 
particle pollution. 

Is there any one of the four of you who has a problem with that 
analysis? Let the record show they agree with that analysis. 
I want to talk to my friend from Alabama and ask you this ques-
tion. I have great respect for your office and your opinion but isn’t 
it true that Alabama lost all recent major Clean Air Act cases? 
Alabama lost its legal challenge to EPA’s CRUS, State air pollu-
tion rule in the Supreme Court. Alabama lost its legal challenge to 
EPA’s mercury and toxic air rule in the D.C. Circuit in the White 
Stallion case. Alabama lost its legal challenge to EPA’s 
endangerment finding and light duty vehicle GHG tailpipe stand-
ards in the case of Coalition for Responsible Regulation. Isn’t that 
a fact? 
240 

Mr. STRANGE. I do not doubt what you are saying, Senator. I do 
not recall. 

Senator BOXER. You do no recall losing those cases? 

Mr. STRANGE. I do and I think you are right, yes. 

Senator BOXER. I think that is important. 
Let me ask a question to Mr. Thomas. 

I know you have talked about the impacts in your home State 
of Florida that you are already seeing. I had the privilege of going 
in a helicopter over the Miami region. When you see how much 
water is there, it takes your breath away. 

I wonder if you could talk about how local communities in the 
State of Florida are joining together to address the growing im-
pacts of climate change. Do many of these local actions have bipar-
tisan support? 

Let me ask Mr. Thomas this. I only have 58 seconds left. 

Mr. THOMAS. Senator, particularly in the south Florida area, 
Miami area, six counties have basically come together specifically 
to work on adaptation measures dealing with the problems they 
are already facing. 

As I indicated, salt water intrusion, the drainage systems, how 
do they deal with today’s problem, an average sea level rise of 
about eight inches which has a significant impact. You are talking 
about areas that both because of their level above sea level but also 
because of the terrain and subsurface, basically the limestone and 
subsurface causes a significant issue in that part of the State. 
We see local governments struggling with the issue, spending 
significant amounts of money and my sense is that is going to be 
an expanding issue and an expanding problem, particularly in the 
south Florida area in the near term. 

I met with a group in the Miami area, including scientists who 
participated in the IPCC process. Their concern is what is hap-
pening today and how it will be exaggerated over the next 10 
years. They are not talking about long term, they are talking about 
10 years. 

Senator BOXER. Let me close by letting everyone know this. 
When it comes to environment, we have big differences. When it 
comes to preparing, we have come together and in the last WRDA 
bill, I wanted to mention that we have taken steps for our coastal 
States and also the Sacramento issue, Mr. Reilly, that you men-
tioned. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Senator Vitter. 

Mr. BOTKIN. May I may a scientific comment? 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. It is not in order. This is the time for Sen-
ators to ask questions. 

Senator Vitter, you are recognized. 

Senator VITTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

As I always am in these discussions, I am frustrated again, quite 
frankly at some of the cartoonist nature of the assertions, going 
after strawmen instead of having a detailed, serious discussion. I 
think Senator Boozman’s comment and explanation of the 97 per-
cent figure really goes to that. 

Ninety-seven percent believe in this consensus about climate 
change. However, it is defined so broadly that all or virtually all 
the Republican members of this committee would be among the 97 
241 

percent. I hope we can get beyond going after strawmen and hav-
ing these sorts of cartoonish conversations. 
With that theme of science, real science, real discipline in mind, 
let me start there. Of all of our panelists, who has graduate ad-
vanced degrees in the natural sciences? Dr. Botkin, let me ask you, 
in my opinion one of these areas with cartoonish claims and out-
landish claims is about severe weather multiplying every day. 
In fact, what is the historical record about the severity and fre-
quency overall of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts and floods? 

Mr. BOTKIN. As you had in past testimony from Roger Pielke, Jr., 
the analysis shows that these have not increased in terms of major 
storms. If that is the specific question, there has not been an in-
crease in tornadoes and major storms according to his analysis. 

Senator VITTER. I just point that out because that is one of the 
most common rallying cries about this cartoonish debate, severe 
weather. 

Also, let us talk about real science. We have here obviously a 
huge issue which is whatever we do, what is the rest of the world 
doing. These posters just illustrate what China is doing but there 
are other countries that are a major factor—India, Brazil and so 
forth. 

Dr. Botkin, with this in mind, will the EPA’s rule, as currently 
constructed, have a significant effect on global average tempera-
tures or sea level rise? 

Mr. BOTKIN. The scientific analyses show that if the United 
States acts alone, it will have a very insignificant effect but that 
does leave open whether this is supposed to be a leadership action 
or a scientific effective but in terms of the United States acting 
alone, it will have a very minor effect. 
Senator VITTER. Thank you. 

Mr. BOTKIN. May I make a comment about sea level rise? 
Senator VITTER. Go ahead but be very brief. My time is limited. 

Mr. BOTKIN. Most of the comments were about sea level rise. It 
is well known to geologists, oceanographers and glaciologists that 
the sea level has been rising since the end of the last ice age, 
12,500 years ago. The average estimated rate and measured rate 
has been a foot a century. That is natural background. 
It was mentioned specifically by one of the Senators was that it 
has risen ten inches in one place since 1930. Actually, that is with-
in that natural background. 

Senator VITTER. Doctor, I do not mean to cut you off but this is 
on my limited time. 

Mr. BOTKIN. I just wanted to say that is completely natural. 
Senator VITTER. Let us go on to the other big impact we can 
measure which is economic impact. Dr. Mason, this is not a theo-
retical discussion. Europe has basically been living this in the last 
ten plus years and is in the process of essentially reversing course. 
A headline from The New York Times reads ‘‘Europe Facing Eco-
nomic Pain May Ease Climate Rules’’; the Bloomberg News, ‘‘Coal 
Returns to German Utilities Replacing Low Cost Nuclear’’; the 
Guardian, ‘‘Soaring Energy and Housing Costs Force Poorest 
Homes to Turn to Food Banks’’; and the New York Times, ‘‘Renew-
able Energy in Spain Is Taking A Beating.’’ What should we ob-
serve and learn about that European experience? 
242 

Mr. MASON. I think you have to acknowledge that in terms of the 
treatment in this medical analogy, prior carbon policy has been the 
equivalent of medieval blood letting. It has not worked, it is not 
constraining emissions in world markets and there are two things 
you have to notice.
 
First of all, there is already a market developed not only to argue 
against taking action with respect to carbon; there is a market de-
veloped in setting up these financial trading desks that trade car-
bon, that wants to lobby to undertake this option. It is a very 
strong and very large industry right now. 
There are interest groups pushing for this as a solution that, in 
fact, will not work. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Senator Markey. 

Senator MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I want to go to the EPA Administrators. Thank you all so much 
for your service over the years. 
I have a chart here of U.S. GDP since the Great Depression in 
1929. President Johnson signed the first Clean Air Act into law in 
1963. It was amended in 1970, 1977 and 1990, as indicated on the 
chart. 

I would like a quick answer from each of you. Has GDP, Mr. 
Ruckelshaus, gone up or down since each of these Clean Air Act 
laws? 

Mr. RUCKELSHAUS. Senator, I am not going to argue with your 
chart. It has gone up. 
Senator MARKEY. Thank you. Governor? 

Ms. WHITMAN. I cannot disagree with that. That is a fact. 
Senator MARKEY. Thank you. 

Mr. REILLY. The Clean Air Act amendments we were responsible 
for in 1990 were followed by ten record setting years in GDP 
growth. 

Senator MARKEY. Interesting—not a blood letting then, is that 
what you are saying? 

Mr. REILLY. No, I would not say so. 
Senator MARKEY. You would not say that. Thank you. 

Mr. Thomas. 

Mr. THOMAS. I certainly agree with your chart, it has gone up. 
Senator MARKEY. Do you think that finding new facts of dealing 
with climate change can actually create jobs in our economy by 
unleashing innovation in the marketplace to accomplish that goal, 

Mr. Ruckelshaus? 

Mr. RUCKELSHAUS. There is no question. It will create jobs. It 
will also have some impact on existing employment. 

Ms. WHITMAN. I look on it as not only will it create new jobs in 
some of the renewable fields and fields we have not even talked 
about, but we have one industry already that is producing a lot of 
jobs and can produce a lot more. That is the nuclear energy indus-
try which is a base power which releases none of these greenhouse 
gases or other regulated pollutants while producing power. 

Mr. REILLY. The 1990 amendments created an enormous number 
of jobs both in natural gas and also in western clean coal. 

Mr. THOMAS. I think without question jobs will be created. On 
the other hand, I think it will impact jobs and I think we have a 

243 

responsibility to focus on how we provide assistance to those whose 
jobs are being impacted. 

Senator MARKEY. I would like to move to another example which 
is the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative across the northeast in 
terms of the impact that has had in reducing greenhouse gases and 
at the same time overlapping with an economy across the northeast 
which has continued to grow over those years. 

Since the RGGI was put in place, there has actually been a 40 
percent reduction in greenhouse gases in those States on average 
where it was put in place but in addition, it has helped to save con-
sumers money, created jobs, generated over $750 million in eco-
nomic value in the State of Massachusetts alone from 2009 to 2013. 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit all of that economic data 
for the record. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Without objection. 
[The referenced information follows:]

Economic Benefits of RGGI
June 2013

RGGI at a Glance:
* 9 States (MD, DE, NY, CT, RI, MA, VT, NH & ME)
* Applies to CO2 emitting power plants over 25 MW
* Went into effect Jan 1. 2009
* At quarterly auctions power plants purchase allowances to
cover emissions.
* Revenue reinvested according to state plans
* Reforms to cap level-and other changes take effect in 2014

States participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative 
(RGGI) have gained significant benefits from the program to date, 
and far greater benefits will be realized by implementing recently 
agreed reforms. 

Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants in the region have
dropped significantly since RGGI was formed. Meanwhile. revenue
from auctions of allowances (permits to emit C02) has been 
invested in energy efficiency and other consumer programs that 
reduce energy costs while increasing economic output and 
employment. RGGl—funded energy efficiency programs reduce 
expenditures for fossil fuels imported to generate power, thus
making states more competitive while reducing carbon emissions.
RGGI states have agreed to program improvements based on the
first four years of operation — most importantly the allowance budget (the “cap”) is being reduced to
account for long-lasting changes in the electricity sector that have brought emissions to historic lows[i]
Implementing these reforms and investing additional RGGI revenue in clean energy and other consumer
programs will benefit participating states significantly.

Benefits To-Date

Tracking RGGI dollars through state reinvestment programs makes it possible to calculate RGGI’S
impact on member states" economies to—date, taking into account direct effects of projects funded by
RGGI, as well as broader impacts from wages and efficiency savings boos ting consumer spending
throughout the economy. Through June 2013 sales of allowances have generated $1.4 billion in revenue,
which has been reinvested in energy efficiency and other programs that add $24 billion in net value to
participating states’ economies over 10 years. This increase in growth generates over 23,000 job years of
employment across the economy (each job year represents one full time job for 1 year). [ii]

Benefits from a Strengthened RGGI

In order to account for the significant and enduring decline in C02 emissions since RGGl began, RGGI
states agreed to reduce the oversupply of allowances and reset the cap at current emissions levels (91
million tons). If states continue to invest additional revenue from RGGI according to existing
plans, through 2020 RGGI could generate an additional $3.2 billion in funding and add over $8
billion in net value and 57,000 job years of employment to state economics.[iii]

<See original for figure: Improved RGGI - Additional Benefits 2013-2020>

*New Jersey ceased participation in RGGI and received no funding after 2011

Page 245

The Role of Energy Efficiency

The majority of auction proceeds across the region are used to support energy efficiency programs.
which directly benefit consumers in a number of ways:

* First, reduced energy consumption due to efficiency improvements brings down monthly electric
bills for participating consumers.

* Second, reduced consumption decreases wholesale electricity prices, delivering additional savings
to all consumers

* Third. reduced demand for electricity brings down emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants,
decreasing the demand for allowances and the overall cost of reducing emissions.

Efficiency investments also create the highest level of economy- wide benefits by creating local
efficiency-related jobs, by reducing expenditures on imported fossil fuels, and by boosting consumer
spending on other goods and services. Direct employment benefits of efficiency programs range from
energy service contractors who install insulation and efficient equipment to manufacturers of advanced
energy saving technologies. Indirect employment benefits accrue across the economy as the money
customers save on monthly energy bills is spent locally, benefitting everyone from bus drivers to bus
boys. In New England states every $1 spent on electric energy efficiency improvements creates $4.30 to
$6.40 in economic activity.“ While all states accrue net benefits from participation in RGGI, states
investing greater proportions of auction proceeds in efficiency derive the greatest benefits.

Notes:

Notes: Recent analysis of RGG emissions trends and drivers by ENIZ finds that fuel-switching, non-emitting generation and efficiency investments have caused emissions to fall ~35% to 45% below the cap since the program began in 2009, and these trends show no sign of reversing.

Senator MARKEY. Governor Whitman, maybe you could talk 
about that issue, about the job creation aspect of this, especially 
since it seems to be a core argument here using medieval blood let-
ting terms to describe what the impact is since the States in the 
RGGI have actually seen economic growth. 

Ms. WHITMAN. I think it is absolutely fair to say that obviously 
there are going to be jobs that will be impacted with whatever ac-
tions we take. That has always been true. When we have an obliga-
tion to ensure that we do the best we can for those who will be im-
pacted and find other ways of earning a living and recognize that 
this is real and people will get hurt. 

One of the things you learn as a Governor, as anybody in a posi-
tion where you have to make decisions, is you cannot make a deci-
sion that has an equal impact on everyone. Some people will not 
see the same benefits as others and may see a down turn. It is your 
obligation to do what is in the best interest of the greatest number 
and do everything you can to mitigate the down side for those who 
will be negatively impacted. 

I think we have seen that time and again. We have been able 
to do that in this Country and been able to increase jobs. 

Senator MARKEY. Mr. Thomas, Dr. Botkin has argued for more 
direct observations of climate variables. You mentioned both sea 
level rise and an increase in heavy rainfall in your testimony. Sea 
level rise and rainfall have been measured by scientists for dec-
ades. They are not theoretical or models. 
What are the impacts of those directly observed changes on your 
own home State, Mr. Thomas? 

Mr. BOTKIN. Excuse me, Senator. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Could you please allow Mr. Thomas to an-
swer the question he has been asked? 

Mr. THOMAS. Senator, as I indicated to Senator Boxer, clearly 
south Florida particularly is dealing today with sea level rise as it 
impacts both saltwater intrusion on our coastal areas, impacts our 
drinking water, draining systems that are critical to the overall 
well being of many of the coastal communities in south Florida. 
Today’s sea level rise is indeed an issue in our State just as it 
is in a number of other States. 

Senator MARKEY. I am the son of a milkman so I know that tech-
nological change can occur. The invention of refrigerators actually 
made obsolete delivery of milk each morning. It does not mean 
there were more milkmen that were created; it meant there was an 
absence of jobs that were created to revolutionize the way in which 
that industry operated. We have seen that from the beginning of 
time and we have to embrace it here. The job creation is obvious. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Senator Inhofe. 
Senator INHOFE. That is pretty good. I enjoyed that. 
First of all, let me mention that we keep talking about the Clean 
Air Act amendments of 1990. I want everyone to know not only did 
I vote for them, but I was an original co-sponsor of those. 
They worked. That was dealing with real pollutants—SOx and 
NOx. It was never meant to deal with CO2. I think we all under-
stand that. The successes were there. You could actually use that 
as an argument against going into regulating something that most

of us do not believe is a pollutant, but we will not make that argu-
ment. 

I think Senator Boozman has pretty much defused the 97 per-
cent. We are going to hear it over and over again but he has pretty 
well answered that. 

I had a question for the three of you but I am going to skip you, 
Attorney General Strange, because Jeff already asked the question. 
I have to say this, that Scott Pruitt holds you in the highest regard 
among all the attorneys general in the United States. 
Dr. Botkin, you are the only scientist on this panel. I would like 
to ask you this. I happened to be in Copenhagen when this whole 
thing broke. Everything was predicated on the assumption that 
IPCC was going to be accurate—they were the ones who started 
this whole thing. 

I was there when Climate Gate broke. We all remember that is 
where they uncovered the IPCC had manipulated reports, covered 
up errors and made their global warming case stronger than it 
was. 

The way that was kind of covered up in our media here, we have 
kind of an alarmist bias in our media here but throughout the 
world, it was not. The UK Telegraph I think is the largest printed 
publication in the UK. It says, ‘‘The Worse Scientific Scandal of 
Our Generation.’’ The Financial Times said, ‘‘The Stink of Intellec-
tual Corruption Is Overpowering.’’ The Guardian said, ‘‘It Is No 
Use Pretending That This Isn’t A Major Blow.’’ 
I ask you as a scientist, why do you think there are people who 
still believe that this science was generated? The reason I am ask-
ing this question is because if you go back and look at my website 
in 2002, you will see I listed not a few but hundreds of scientists 
who disagreed with the IPCC. Your comments on that? 

Mr. BOTKIN. Senator, I have asked myself this question many 
times because what I do is look at the facts and check all the facts. 
I found that the IPCC reports are not consistent and are biased. 
Are you asking me why do so many people believe that? 

Senator INHOFE. That is good. 

Mr. BOTKIN. I have puzzled about that a great deal. I can say 
that one of my favorite books is by Charles McCabe published in 
1841. 

Senator INHOFE. We are running out of time. 

Mr. BOTKIN. I do not think there is a scientific answer to why 
so many people have come to believe this. It has become a popular 
issue. All I try to do is look at the facts. I have worked very hard 
to try to determine the effects of this over my career and I feel this 
data has changed and that it is less of an effect and danger than 
we thought before. I am surprised and shocked. 

Senator VITTER. Dr. Mason, you being the only economist on this 
panel, let me ask you a question. 

Years ago when this first started, a lot of us believed it was true 
because that was what was supposed to be believed. It happened 
at that time that I chaired this committee. When I found out they 
were talking about what the cost would be, if you remember the 
Wharton Econometric Survey came out, the MIT came out, Charles 
Rivers came out, and all came to the same conclusion on the cost

of this. We were talking about the cost of cap and trade would be 
between $300-$400 billion a year. 
First, I would ask if you agreed with that analysis with them at 
that time? 

Mr. MASON. I have not run the job losses particularly, but I 
would not be surprised at all by that. 

Senator INHOFE. That is the one thing that is pretty consistent. 
We have not had a lot of people disagree with that. My question 
would be this. These bills we are talking about, the first was the 
McCain-Lieberman bill in 2003, then in 2005, the same thing, the 
Warner-Lieberman and it went on up to Senator Markey, when he 
was in the House, had a bill, all of them were talking about regu-
lating the emissions of entities that emitted 25,000 tons or more. 
The Clean Air Act regulates 250 tons or more. 

I would ask you as an economist, if it is true that it would be 
between $300-$400 billion a year for the 25,000 tons or more, do 
you have any idea what it would cost the American people if they 
were able to successfully regulate this under the Clean Air Act? 
Mr. MASON. Orders of magnitude more. 

Senator INHOFE. That is a good answer. 
Thank you very much. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Senator Boozman? 

Senator BOOZMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Professor Mason, in your testimony, you address disparitive goals 
across States. Arkansas is one of the most difficult targets in the 
Country. You said there will be State level impacts that affect jobs 
and growth. Would you explain how these impacts can impact op-
portunities in States like Arkansas and what that will mean for 
consumers? 

Mr. MASON. Very simply, to the extent that consumers in these 
States derive energy from plants in those States, again, those con-
sumers will pay more for their electricity. This is where things get 
wonky because you will have cross State effects. 
Will Arkansas be able to, for instance, buy emissions from other 
States to satisfy their emissions? How are we going to control that? 
What can they buy? Can they buy permits or offsets internationally 
from Hungary which defrauded investors leading to this market 
shutdown I cited or other Third World countries that have been 
known not to even bother to check validity of the permits they are 
selling on markets leading to this fraud and international prob-
lems? 

We need to deal with these details. Until we actually sit down 
and look at these and look at the job losses that are very real— 
the Fed does this at every meeting when they talk about raising 
rates. They look at job losses and look at economic output. 
I think that we need to look at this with each and every increase 
in energy cost. Just waving your hands and saying, that will be 
fine, is another story because we are getting to a level of policy im-
plementation that is orders of magnitude greater than anything we 
have done before. 

To me from my perspective on financial crises, they arise in part 
because of problems in the market but also scale and magnitude 
relative to the economic system. We have had lots of little mini 
securitization crises since 1990. None affected the economy until

we had it happen with mortgages, a big enough product to throw 
us into recession. 
We can do this and we can put the economy at risk but I think 
we need to think about this real hard before just diving in. This 
is different. 

Senator BOOZMAN. That is why we have a Congress and congres-
sional hearings, to go through all that theoretically and make sure 
we do it not in haste but get all the intended consequences out on 
the table. 

You mentioned it is like gravity that in order to make something 
not be used, you have to raise the price or that is a method of doing 
it. You mentioned the $30 figure. What would that do to the cost 
of utilities? 

Mr. MASON. RGGI right now is at about $5, California is at about 
$11. It is interesting and those might not have pushed back eco-
nomic growth but they are not pricing carbon either. They are just 
adding to the cost of energy with no upside benefit in terms of car-
bon. 

Thirty dollars is definitely going to raise prices further. We have 
seen 45 percent in the northeast cited today. I would expect prices 
would go up by orders of magnitude greater than that. 
Let me just say that there has been a lot of talk today about 
leadership in terms of carbon policy. Leadership is not just grab-
bing this failed system out of the EU or this ineffective system out 
of RGGI or California and plopping it down nationwide. 
Leadership is really thinking more deeply about the implementa-
tion of carbon policy and coming up with something better than the 
rest of the world has put together so far, implementing it and then 
having the rest of the world follow. 

That is why I cited the National Monetary Commission with re-
spect to the Federal Reserve. We did that. We have the best central 
bank in the world. Like or hate the details of it, we still lead in 
that throughout the world. I think we owe to our citizens to put 
together a very thoughtful approach, to put together a meaningful 
approach to carbon that can actually help the world while also pric-
ing an economic externality that is very real. 

Senator BOOZMAN. Thank you very much. 

Dr. Botkin, you would be one of the 97 percent that is talked 
about and certainly you feel like man is contributing and this and 
that but certainly you are not one that feels like the models are 
acceptable. I suspect you have many of your cohorts in the same 
camp. 

Mr. BOTKIN. I think the key thing here is that science is not a 
rule by majority method. That is the important thing. It is dis-
covery. 

I would like to quote Jonas Saulk, the inventor of the polio vac-
cine. He said, ‘‘I get into dialog with nature and put the question 
to nature, not to my colleagues because that is from whence the an-
swer must come.’‘ That is what I do. I always look at the data. 
Also, Richard Feynman, one of the great 20th Century physicists, 
said ‘‘Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.’‘ To keep say-
ing it is a majority is not a scientific statement and is not correct. 
I have spent 50 years working on climate change in a very con-
structive way. What I can tell you is that since about 1990, the 

VerDate Aug 31 2005 10:54 Feb 25, 2016 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00255 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\_EPW\DOCS\98181.TXT VERN

data has started to move in the other direction away from an im-
portant effect by human beings. That is just what the facts show. 
Senator BOOZMAN. Thank you very much. 
My concern is certainly we need to examine the increased risk 
of this, but I can tell you there is tremendous increased risk for the 
men and women sitting back there and the hard working people of 
Arkansas if we are talking about a 45 percent or much greater 
probably in our case increase in utility prices. 
As far as jobs, we talk a lot about income disparity in this Coun-
try, what does that do to working moms, single moms and what 
does that do to people on fixed incomes? 
Again, thank you, Mr. Chair. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you very much, Senator Boozman. 
That will conclude the questioning. Let me just say some final 
thanks to our witnesses who are here. I appreciate particularly the 
efforts of the former Administrators. I would ask if Mr. Reilly and 
Mr. Thomas would answer my question for the record. 
The record will be kept open for an additional 2 weeks for anyone 
who wishes to add material to the record. 

I will ask unanimous consent to put in a review of the investiga-
tions that were prompted by what is called Climate Gate but I con-
tend is more accurately called Climate Gate Gape. In my view, the 
scandal was a phony scandal that was whipped up at the expense 
of a lot of scientific work that was then reviewed I think by six dif-
ferent authorities, including American investigators, independent 
investigators, university investigators and British investigators, 
every one of which gave a full clean bill of health to the science. 
I think that needs to be a part of the record if members are going 
to bring up so-called Climate Gate. 

[The referenced information was not receive at time of print.] 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. There has been some reference to the pro-
jections by the Chamber of Commerce as to what this proposed 
EPA regulation might cost. Some of our colleagues have leapt to 
cite that report but I think it is important for the hearing that we 
also include the Washington Post analysis of their claims which 
earned four Pinocchio’s. 

Depending on how far you get from the truth, you get more 
Pinocchio’s relating back to the story of Pinocchio, the wooden doll, 
whose nose would grow when he was not being truthful. I will in-
clude the Washington Post four Pinocchio finding about that. 
There is also an organization named PolitiFact which analyzes 
claims made, the political debate and tries to do a very neutral 
analysis of their accuracy. PolitiFact ruled a false for that report. 
I think in the interest of fairness, those should be admitted. 
I will ask unanimous consent that those two documents be ad-
mitted. 

[The referenced information was not receive at time of print.] 
Senator SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. Senator Sessions. 
Senator SESSIONS. Just to wrap up, I thank the panel for your 
testimony. This is an important issue. I believe Dr. Botkin is cor-
rect in saying that actual empirical data is not confirming the pro-
jections we have seen so far and a host of other areas. I will be sub-
mitting some documents to that effect. 


251 

I think it is appropriate for Congress to ask questions. Also, I 
would just say it is unacceptable that scientists like Dr. Botkin and 
others are being adversely treated as a result of their statements 
and scientific research that sometimes contradicts the powers that 
be. 
Thank you. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. You are very welcome. It is always a 
pleasure to work with my Ranking Member. However much we 
may disagree on things, he is a very courteous colleague and we 
always work well together. 
I think this was not a hearing on the science. It was a hearing 
with the experience of previous Administrators. If we were to do a 
hearing on the science, then I think we would be adding scientists 
from NOAA, NASA, and the scientists who back our United States 
defense establishment and a great establishment of scientists, 
every major scientific organization in the Country. 
Perhaps Dr. Botkin is right and they are all wrong but I am not 
sure that would be the prudent course for our Country. 
Thank you all very much. 
We are adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 12:29 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
