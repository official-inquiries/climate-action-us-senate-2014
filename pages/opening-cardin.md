We turn now to Senator Cardin. 
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN CARDIN, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND 

Senator CARDIN. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. I thank you for 
your extraordinary leadership on this issue. You have been incred-
ibly helpful to this Country in the leadership you have taken, par-
ticularly in your comments on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
I want to start by thanking our panelists today for what you 
have done to improve the public health for the people in this Na-
tion. You have put public health first and that is what Congress 
intended when it passed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water 
Act. It was done by bipartisan votes. 

The Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 with bipartisan support 
by the Members of Congress in both the House and the Senate and 
signed into law by President Nixon. You have given us the bipar-
tisan or nonpartisan foundation for us to have clean water and 
clean air. Now we need to move forward in that tradition. Unfortu-
nately, we have not. 

I hope we can get back to the same type of spirit that inspired 
you to use your talent at the EPA as we move forward to advance 
the public health of the people of this Country. 
Seven years ago when I was first elected to the Senate, we had 
bipartisan members in the Senate working together on climate 
change legislation. I hope we can get back to that day and get that 
bipartisan coalition together. 

Quite frankly, the solution is one which will answer every mem-
ber’s concerns. Yes, many of us, most of us, are concerned about

the environmental public health threat that climate change poses. 
I have the honor of representing the State of Maryland. Our great-
est natural resource is the Chesapeake Bay. 

We are doing a lot. We have asked our farmers to do a lot. We 
have asked our developers to do a lot. Our municipal governments 
have done a lot. We have worked together in the public and private 
sector. A large part of the problem deals with climate change, ris-
ing sea levels nad the loss of sea grasses. Therefore, climate change 
affects the quality of life for the people of Maryland. 

The scientific information on our environment is pretty clear on 
public health. As pointed out, 97 percent of the published scientific 
documents indicate we have a serious threat that we can do some-
thing about and we need to take action. 

By way of example, if I went to a doctor and 97 percent of the 
opinion was that I had pneumonia and unless I took certain action, 
I was risking my health, I would take action, as would every per-
son in this Country. 

It is clear that the overwhelming evidence is that we need to 
take action and move to preserve the public health, not just of 
America, but globally and the future health of our climate. 
The good news is we don’t really have to get into debate with the 
other 3 percent because the solution to the problem of climate 
change not means a cleaner environment and a safer circumstance 
for global climate, it also helps our economy. 

I would just point to the Maryland experience. We passed some 
of the toughest environmental laws for our power plants and it cre-
ated jobs. We can show you the number of jobs that were created. 
Clean energy creates more jobs than the fossil fuel industry. 
There are those saying maybe this is not true, you certainly want 
to do it for our economic growth in this Country. It also helps us 
with national security. We have talked about that. We have made 
progress and are now more energy secure than we were a few years 
ago because we have invested in cleaner energy sources to help 
support America’s security, economy and our environment. 

I can also point to the fact that from our security point of view, 
many of our military facilities are located on the coast. In Mary-
land, we are very proud of the Naval Academy, PAX River, Aber-
deen Proving Grounds, Indian Head. All those are threatened by 
sea level increases. It is in our national security interest to do this. 
The bottom line is the United States needs to exercise leader-
ship. President Obama is doing that by his climate action agenda 
and by regulating what power plants are doing. We have seen our 
President provide the leadership that has made a huge difference. 
It is now time for Congress to step up and join the President so 
America can be a leader in dealing with this global problem that 
affects the security of our Country and affects the future of our 
globe. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Cardin. 
Our distinguished Ranking Member and my friend, Senator Ses-
sions, but he has allowed us to keep the existing order so I will rec-
ognize Senator Boozman.
