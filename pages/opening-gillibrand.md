## OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, 
## U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK 

Senator GILLIBRAND. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse, 
for chairing this hearing today on the need to act on climate change 
and for your leadership in the Senate to continue to raise the ur-
gency of this issue. 

Madam Chairwoman, I am deeply grateful for your leadership 
and your continued focus on how important this is for our families 
and our Country. 

Climate change is real, it is here and humans have a role to play 
in it. That much is clear. While it might be easy for some to con-
tinue to deny the existence of climate change, we simply do not 
have that luxury in New York. 

In my State, we are seeing the effects of a changing climate 
every single day. Two and a half years ago, Superstorm Sandy dev-
astated coastal New York as well as New Jersey, Connecticut, 
Rhode Island and its effects were long felt on the entire Atlantic 
coast. 

That was just 2 years after two other devastating storms, Hurri-
cane Irene and tropical storm Lee, which cut a path of destruction 
all across the northeast. These major tropical storms in New York 
over a 2-year period is a huge issue we have to face. 
The storm of the century is simply becoming the storm of the 
year. It is not just the storms themselves that are causing the de-
struction. Sea levels rise and are threatening greater storm surge 
effects, meaning that homes thought to be safe for centuries are 
now at grave risk of flooding. 

Those who deny that climate change is real often talk about the 
potential costs of reducing carbon emissions, but we must weigh 
those costs against the cost of inaction. Inaction on climate change 
will cost the Federal Government and our taxpayers billions and 
billions and billions of dollars.

We have already seen Superstorm Sandy cost more than $60 bil-
lion. In action on climate change also cost homeowners who live in 
coastal communities. Their flood insurance premiums have gone up 
with sea levels rising, it is causing greater flooding and FEMA’s 
flood maps were released a year ago show an expansion of New 
York City’s 100 year flood plain by 15 square miles. That is 45 per-
cent. All of New York City is now having to be contemplated. 
It also has real cost to my State and the people who live there 
when these storms strike. Rebuilding a home or a business is very 
expensive. Suffering the loss of a child or a family member because 
of a storm, you don’t recover from it. These are real costs. These 
have insurmountable losses and effects. 

We have to realize that is the effect of the change in our climate. 
We have to address the issue head on. If we address the issue head 
on, we will save lives, we will lower costs, we will protect families’ 
homes and communities and we will protect businesses. 

We also know for the economy, when we look to reducing our car-
bon emissions, we also gain greater innovation and business oppor-
tunities in clean energy. In fact, a recent report by the Environ-
ment Northeast showed that States that do participate in regional 
greenhouse gas initiatives have seen carbon pollution reduced by 
18 percent and their economies have actually grown by 8.8 percent. 
The report also showed that since the launch of RGGI, New 
York’s electricity prices have actually gone down. They have gone 
down by 6 percent. I am confident that we, this Nation, and some 
of the greatest entrepreneurs and innovators in the world can solve 
this problem and do it in the way that can save all Americans 
costs. 

The real and clear issue with regard to climate change is that it 
is a threat we have to take seriously as a Nation. We cannot wait 
for other countries who are even bigger polluters to take leader-
ship. We cannot wait for them to go first. We have to lead. It is 
who we are. We, as Americans, are always in the forefront of real 
reform and change and great innovation. 

Thank you, Senator Whitehouse, again for holding this hearing. 
It is so important for my State and our Country. It is a great op-
portunity for us to show new creation of jobs and new innovation. 
I think we need to take it head on. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Gillibrand. 
I now turn to our distinguished Ranking Member and my friend, 
Senator Sessions.
