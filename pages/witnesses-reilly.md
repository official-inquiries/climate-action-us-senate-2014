Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you very much, Governor Whit-
man. 

 We now turn to Mr. William Reilly. Welcome. 
STATEMENT OF WILLIAM K. REILLY, SENIOR ADVISOR, TPG 
CAPITAL; CHAIRMAN EMERITUS, CLIMATEWORKS FOUNDA-
TION; AND FORMER ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION AGENCY 

Mr. REILLY. Thank, Mr. Chairman, Senator Sessions and mem-
bers of the subcommittee. 

Thank you for convening this session on one of the critical chal-
lenges our Country faces. It is a privilege to appear with two of my 
predecessors and Governor Whitman who served after us. 

After I was nominated in 1988, my first briefing on climate was 
by Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, fol-
lowed soon by briefings on EPA’s reports on climate effects and pol-
icy options commissioned by Administrator Thomas. 

Incidentally, 11 National Academy of Science since that time 
have formally reflected upon and studied climate science and have 
concluded that humans are affecting the climate and greenhouse 
gases are changing it. 

At that time, climate science was a matter of computer modeling, 
coupled with theory, notably the greenhouse effect, which explains 
why the earth’s atmosphere is hospitable to life. At that time, the 
concern was sufficient to prompt then Secretary of State Jim Baker 
in his first statement on the topic to signal a policy of no regrets. 
We will consider those measures, he said, that address current pri-
orities that also help reduce gas emissions. 

The 1987 Montreal Protocol, which Lee Thomas helped negotiate, 
is an example of this kind of thinking. That was 25 years ago. 
Today, the models are far more reliable and they are buttressed by 
literally thousands of credible scientific studies documenting 
changes underway. 

I listened to Senator Boozman. There are still many outstanding 
questions, the pace of change, tipping points, local impacts, fugitive 
methane emissions and more. The earth’s climate is a complex sys-
tem. We do not have a complete picture. We welcome serious, con-
structive critiques that examine gaps, anomalies and uncertainties. 
That is how science advances our understanding of such complex 
issues. 

Change is underway. We can expect to see many more disrup-
tions, more intense storms, more wildfires, the spread of pests and 
diseases, dengue fever will arrive in America, storm surges that 
overwhelm coastal communities, heat waves and other impacts on 
our health, on water resources, on food production and on other 
sectors of our economy. 

The longer we delay, the more adverse the impacts will be and 
the more expensive will be to address them. Reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide, can help fend off more 
draconian impacts later this century. 

I increasingly believe we have a second, immediate agenda, 
namely to prompt States, communities and our Federal agencies to 
begin to adapt to likely changes and to buildup resiliency. Dealing 
with flooding and meeting future projections from storm surges will

be costly and add to growing demands on Federal, State and local 
budgets. I chaired a force task on adaptation for Governor 
Schwarzenegger. We concluded that the 1,100 levees in the Sac-
ramento Basin simply will not survive anticipated sea level rise. 
Climate change and associated disruptions, as has been pointed 
out, are a global problem. Absent action by China, Brazil, India 
and other fast growing economies, what we do alone will not suf-
fice. 

Action by the United States, if not sufficient, is nonetheless nec-
essary if we are to have credibility to negotiate with other coun-
tries who typically fault the developed world for causing the prob-
lem and worry that carbon constraints will thwart their legitimate 
needs for economic growth. 

I must express some disappointment that the debate between de-
veloped and developing countries has tended to focus more on how 
much financial aid advanced nations are willing to provide rather 
than on the substance of how much and how to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions in those nations. 
I participated for a number of years in the China Sustainable 
Energy Forum. At first, throughout the 1990’s, any mention of cli-
mate change triggered a lecture about how those who caused the 
problem should pay for fixing it globally. 
As China has begun to experience serious impacts, especially in 
water resources, it now is a matter of self interest that they re-
spond and join constructively in international negotiations, even as 
they continue to assert the national interest in development. 
China announced 1 day after the announcement by EPA of its 
new carbon rule that they intend to build a cap on carbon dioxide. 
This is obviously a response to the United States, a significant one, 
and it is further demonstration of U.S. leadership. 
Markets the world over seek clean energy technologies. Well over 
a billion people do not have electricity. For many, it will be small 
scale, renewable technologies that will help improve their lives and 
offer new economic opportunities. 
Technology and innovation are a comparative advantage for our 
Country that will help control what we can and help find ways to 
replace the most serious contributors to the climate challenge. 
This is an enormous opportunity for U.S. entrepreneurs and ex-
porters, even as we deploy more clean energy at home. While the 
President has taken many important steps, a full and constructive 
response is needed from Congress. 
In closing, I have little doubt that the planet will endure major 
climate disruptions. There have been many such episodes in the 
past due to natural causes, but you would have to reject the green-
house effect out right to conclude that human activities pumping 
millions of tons of CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmos-
phere every year are having little or no impact on the earth’s cli-
mate. 
That is simply not a tenable position. For me, the question is 
how hospitable this earth remains for future generations and for 
civilization as we know it. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Statement of the Honorable William K. Reilly
before the
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works
Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety
Washington, D.C.
June 18, 2014

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee,

Thank you for convening this session on one of the critical challenges our country faces.
It is a privilege to appear with two of my predecessors—three if you count Ruckelshaus twice!—
and Governor Whitman, who served after us.

Each of us, during our tenures, had to navigate the complexities of law, science,
economics, public policy, the prevailing winds of politics and public sentiments, and more on
any number of difficult issues to fulfill the intent of Congress and Americans‘ aspirations for
both a healthy, productive environment and a prosperous economy. We did so in what Bill
called a “fishbowl,“ all of it out in the open.

After I was nominated, my first briefing was on climate by Frank Press, president of the
National Academy of Sciences, followed soon by briefings on EPA‘s reports on climate effects
and policy options, commissioned by Administrator Thomas. At that time, climate science was a
matter of computer modeling coupled with theory, notably the “greenhouse effect," which I’m
sure you appreciate explains why the earth’s atmosphere is hospitable to life. At the time, the
concern was sufficient to prompt then-Secretary of State Jim Baker in his first statement on the
topic to signal a policy of “no regrets" — we will consider those measures that address current
priorities that also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 1987 Montreal Protocol, which
Lee helped negotiate, is an example of this kind of thinking.

With this as backdrop, President George H.W. Bush ensured that our Administration took
climate change seriously. I met regularly with my counterparts from the European Union to
discuss content, timing, targets, and other key issues. We hosted a major conference during the

Page 113

President’s term. And we negotiated with other countries the Framework Convention on Climate
Change, which the President signed at the Rio Earth Summit in l992 and submitted to the Senate
for ratification, which occurred in October 1992. The Framework Convention remains, for the
United States, the most important international treaty in effect on climate change.

That was 25 years ago. Today, the models are far more reliable and they are buttressed
by literally thousands of credible scientific studies documenting changes underway. I hasten to
add there are still many outstanding questions— the pace of change, tipping points, local impacts,
fugitive methane emissions, and more. Earth’s climate is a complex system and we do not have
a complete picture. We welcome serious, constructive critiques that examine gaps, anomalies,
uncertainties. That is how science advances our understanding of such complex issues.

That said, change is underway and we can expect to see many more disruptions, more
intense storms, more wildfires, the spread of pests and diseases. storm surges that overwhelm
coastal communities, heat waves, and other impacts on our health, on water resources, on food
production, and on other sectors of our economy. The longer we delay, the more adverse the
impacts will be, and the more expensive to address them.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide, can help fend off more
draconian impacts later this century. Yet I increasingly believe that we have a second,
immediate agenda, namely to prompt states and communities and our federal agencies to begin
to adapt to likely changes and to build up resiliency. If you read the Washington Post's June lSth
front-page story on Norfolk, Virginia. you get an excellent picture of the dilemma that
community faces—not to mention what the Navy’s base there faces. Dealing with flooding and
meeting future projections from storm surges will be costly, and the growing demands on
federal, state, and local budgets come at a time when the country seeks to reduce federal debt and
tame federal deficits.

Page 114

In other words, not only is climate change likely to affect natural resources and public
health, but it will have profound effects on our economy.

We have to take seriously that climate change and the associated disruptions are a global
problem, as Members of Congress, policymakers, scientists, and virtually everyone I know have
explicitly acknowledged. Absent action by China, India, and other fast-growing economics,
what we do alone will not suffice. Action by the United States, if not sufficient, is nonetheless
absolutely necessary if we are to have the credibility to negotiate with other countries, who
typically fault the developed world for causing the problem and worry that carbon constraints
will thwart their legitimate need for economic growth. We have to take this need for
development seriously and frame our approach in the international arena with this in mind.

In this international context, I must express some disappointment that the debate between
developed and developing countries has tended to focus more on how much financial aid
advanced nations are willing to provide rather than on the substance of how much and how to
reduce greenhouse gas emission in those nations. l have participated for years in the China
Sustainable Energy Forum; at first. any mention of climate change triggered a lecture about how
those who caused the problem should pay for fixing it globally. That has changed: as China has
begun to experience serious impacts, especially in water resources, you now hear China’s
officials and academics taking the matter very seriously. It is now a matter of national self—
interest that they respond and join constructively in international negotiations even as they
continue to assert their national interest in development.

Markets the world over eagerly seek clean energy technologies. Well over a billion
people do not have electricity. For many, it will be small-scale, renewable technologies that will
help improve their lives, offer new economic opportunities, preserve essential medicines and 
reduce food waste as refrigeration becomes possible, and more

Page 115

Technology and innovation are a comparative advantage for our country that will help
control what we can and help find ways to replace the most serious contributors to the climate
challenge. This is an enormous opportunity for U.S. entrepreneurs and exporters even as we
deploy more clean energy at home. Former Iowa Governor Chip Culver made wind power a
priority and that state went from 5% to 20% of electricity generation from wind power in 5
years; importantly, the state attracted turbine and other manufacturers, which in turn spawned
200 new small businesses in their supply chains. When the Governor asked the companies what
they most needed, the response was worker training and education. We can learn from this
experience.

We have the know-how, the ingenuity, the entrepreneurial spirit, the ability to
demonstrate leadership in tackling this challenge. While the President has taken many important
steps, a full and constructive response is needed from Congress. and I encourage you and your
colleagues to have the kinds of discussions that will lead to congressional action.

In closing, I have little doubt that the planet will endure major climate disruptions. As
scientists have confirmed. there have been many such episodes in the past due to natural
causes—changes in solar output, shifts in the earth‘s orbit, meteor impacts, volcanic eruptions,
and the like. But you would have to reject the “greenhouse effect" outright to conclude that
human activities pumping millions of tons of C02 and other greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere every year are having little or no impact on the earth’s climate. That is simply not a
tenable position. For me, the real question is about the future well-being of our communities,
our settlements, our economy—in short, how hospitable this earth remains for future generations
and for civilization as we know it.

Thank you.

RESPONSES FROM THE HONORABLE WILLIAM K. REILLY
TO QUESTIONS FROM ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS CHAIRMAN BOXER
AND RANKING MEMBER VITTER, PER JULY 9, 2014 LETTER

Senator Whitehouse

1. Before many environmental regulations are applied, dire consequences and worst fear
outcomes are usually perpetuated. How did the worst fears and assumptions of bad outcomes
from environmental regulations turn out in reality as the rules were applied in your own
experience?

Since the landmark environmental statutes were passed during the 1970s, we have
repeatedly heard from the regulated communities and others that this or that rule will
harm the economy, cost jobs, drive industry overseas, and otherwise imperil the United
States.

In 1979, The Conservation Foundation, which I headed, released a detailed study
Environmental Regulation of Industrial Plant Siting which concluded that compliance
costs for these regulations constituted a small fraction of production costs. Labor, raw
materials, transportation, and other factors were the primary drivers for business
decisions.

Moreover, American ingenuity and entrepreneurship have demonstrated again and
again that when we put our mind to it, innovation can help meet environmental
objectives. We heard that catalytic converters would undermine the auto industry; they
didn‘t. We heard that taking lead out of gasoline would harm automobile engines; it
didn’t. During the 1990 clean air amendment negotiations, we were told that
reformulating gasoline to reduce contaminants was costly. When the law passed,
industry found a way to meet the goal.

The fact is since 1970 we have made enormous strides in reducing conventional air
pollutants even while our population has grown, our energy consumption has grown, our
economy has doubled or more.

Senator Vitter

1. Author and environmental activist Bill McKibben has written that “you can have a healthy fossil fuel industry or a healthy planet, but you can't have both.”
Do you agree with this statement?

Continuing each year to pump billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,
in my view, can only further destabilize conditions with serious adverse consequences,
some of which we can foresee, others that will surprise us. Thus, i see the challenge

Page 117

ahead as moving to low carbon energy over time in ways that continue to maintain our
economy.

2. Mr. McKibben has also written that “one way to fight the power [of fossil fuel companies] is to
stop using fossil fuel."

Do you think this is realistic for consumers, in light of the fact that, as the International
Energy Agency noted, “Despite all the attention given to renewable energy, fossil fuels still
produce about four—fifths of the energy consumed worldwide?” Moreover, by 2050, the
REA projects that, even with its most aggressive carbon reduction scenario, fossil fuels
would still provide 45 percent of global energy demand. Do you agree with this projection?
More broadly, do you agree that, even as countries take steps to reduce carbon emissions,
fossil fuels will continue to comprise a substantial portion of the global energy mix in the
coming decades?

I see reliance on fossil fuels globally continuing for some time to come even with the
most optimistic scenario for deploying renewable energy,

3. Mr. McKibben has written that a “huge problem with increased reliance on cheap natural gas:
it undercuts the transition to zero—carbon energy sources like solar and wind power, locking us
into long-term reliance on fossil fuels.”

Do you agree with this statement? Do you believe that “reliance on cheap natural gas” has
been harmful or helpful to the U.S. economy, particularly for consumers and
manufacturers?

At the time of the 1990 amendments to the clean air act, no one had any idea that with
new drilling techniques natural gas would become more available. Nor did any of the
experts on the National Commission on Energy Policy, which included the CEO of a
major oil company, a former Deputy Secretary at DOE, utility executives, scientists, and
others appreciate what was coming when we released our report in 2004. All argued for
conserving natural gas supplies for those purposes for which there were no alternatives.

The advent of natural gas through horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has been a
game changer. Though there are long term implications since new power plants
typically have a 40 year or longer life span, there seems to me ample evidence that new
sources of natural gas have been a plus for the country and the economy - provided it
is extracted safely with proper safeguards regarding waste disposal, protection of water
resources, reduction of fugitive air emissions, including methane leaks, and with
community development impacts in mind, as well as respect for private property rights.
With sufficient planning, preparedness, safety procedures, and oversight, i believe
hydraulic fracturing can proceed as an industrial operation.

Page 118

4. Activist Naomi Klein wrote that “with the fossil-fuel industry, wrecking the planet is their
business model. It’s what they do.”
Do you agree with this statement?

I‘m not aware of any US, company, fossil fuel or otherwise, that deliberately seeks as a
business strategy to “wreck the planet.” That said, there have been many examples
during our history when unintended consequences, new information about impacts,
technological innovation that leads to less costly, less troublesome modes, or other
factors have caused us to re—think how we do business, how we sustain our economy
and improve opportunities and the quality of life for all Americans

5. On November 3, 2013, climate scientists Kerry Emanuel, Tom Wigley, James Hansen, and Ken
Caldeira, in an open letter to environmentalists, disputed the notion that world energy demand
could be met with 100 percent renewables. Nuclear, they contend, must be part of the equation:
“Renewables like wind and solar and biomass will certainly play roles in a future energy
economy, but those energy sources cannot scale up fast enough to deliver cheap and reliable
power at the scale the global economy requires. While it may be theoretically possible to
stabilize the climate without nuclear power, in the real world there is no credible path to
climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power.”

Do you agree with the authors of this statement?

l consider nuclear power a significant, indeed essential, part of the country’s electricity
generation. i say this with full appreciation that a new large, multi~reactor plant can cost
in the range of $12 to $14 billion or more, prompting the former CEO of Exelon, the
utility with the largest nuclear fleet, to comment that was the market capitalization of his
entire company and he would not be willing to bet his company on such a costly
undertaking.

Add to this challenge the matter of waste disposal and the United States’ clear security
interest in preventing nuclear proliferation.

That is one reason l'm intrigued by the prospect of small scale reactors, less costly and
suitable for deployment at installations, campuses, industrial parks and in combination
with micro grids.

Their deployment is some years off, i believe, and thus we need to look for means of
ensuring that current nuclear plants can continue to contribute to meeting the country’s
energy demand, with safety in mind, of course, We been impressed with the institute
for Nuclear Power Operations’ ability to improve performance continually,

6. According to Ted Nordhaus and Michael Schellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute,
“Whatever their merits as innovation policy, Germany’s enormous solar investments have had
little discernible impact on carbon emissions. Germany’s move away from baseload zero—

Page 119

carbon nuclear has resulted in higher coal consumption since 2009. In 2012, Germany's carbon
emissions rose 2 percent.”

Do you agree with this statement? Do you believe the U.S. should deploy more nuclear
instead of relying on renewables to provide baseload power?

Though I am familiar with Germany‘s intent to advance renewable power, I do not have
the precise numbers of what has or has not been achieved.

As to the future of nuclear power, please see my response to question 5. I believe
market forces will largely shape what kind of nuclear plants are built.

7. According to an analysis by the Economist magazine, renewable energy targets in Germany are
popular, but their economic consequences are not. As the Economist explained, consumers
“increasingly dislike” the “side-effects” of subsidizing renewable energy. “first, there is the
rising cost of electricity. This is a consequence of a renewable-energy law passed in 2000 which
guarantees not only 20 years of fixed high prices for solar and wind producers but also
preferred access to the electricity grid. As a result, Bavarian roofs now gleam with solar panels
and windmills dominate entire landscapes. Last year, the share of renewables in electricity
production hit a record 23.4%.”

The Economist explained further, “This subsidy is costly. The difference between the market
price for electricity and the higher fixed price for renewables is passed on to consumers, whose
bills have been rising for years. An average household now pays an extra €260 ($355) a year to
subsidize renewables: the total cost of renewable subsidies in 2013 was €16 billion. Costs are
also going up for companies, making them less competitive than rivals from America, where
energy prices are falling thanks to the tracking boom.”

Do you believe that Germany’s renewable energy policies have delivered zero-carbon
energy without harming consumers? Do you believe that states, as they attempt to meet
EPA’s emissions targets under the proposed Clean Power Plan for existing power plants,
can both deploy more renewable energy while doing so without raising the cost of
electricity, or imposing higher costs on consumers?

I do not know enough about Germany’s current electricity costs, the history of such
costs, the level of subsidies or other factors to answer the first part of the question.

Regarding the impact of EPA’s proposal, the proposal is just that - a proposal subject to
extensive consultations with stakeholders, which l’m confident will lead to adjustments
in the final rule. As that rule takes shape, more reliable cost estimates should be
forthcoming.

My sense is that electricity costs will rise regardless of this rule as we will have to deal
forthrightly with grid reliability, planning, preparedness, and recovery related to natural
disasters, cybersecurity, power outages, more costly fuel extraction methods, as well as
externalities — impacts on health, crops, buildings, and the like.

Page 120

8. Do you think the U.S. drilling boom, spurred by the technological advance of hydraulic
fracturing, coupled with horizontal drilling, has been positive or negative for the US. economy,
particularly for consumers?

Please see the response to question 3.

9. Do you think EPA’s Clean Power Plan will have a meaningful effect on reducing global
greenhouse gas concentrations by 2030? Please explain how the Clean Power Plan will prevent
rising sea levels, droughts, wildfires, and severe weather.

I refer to my testimony in which I stated that EPA‘s action, indeed U.S. action, by itself
will not be sufficient to reverse or slow the impacts associated with climate change.
Nonetheless, i see it as an essential step —- absent Congressional action on a national
response — if the United State is to have credibility in negotiating an international
framework that ensures China, lndia, Brazil, and other fast growing economies meet
their obligations.

ll). As you are at least tangentially aware, fossil resources provide the base molecules and products
that we need to manufacture virtually everything we use in a modern society. In fact, coal
combustion byproducts are what comprise, strengthen and make possible our roads and
infrastructure. Chemicals derived from oil and natural gas production are what are refined and
manufactured into virtually every product we use today, from computers to our homes, and are
what make possible wind turbines (all components derived, manufactured or refined from fossil
fuels) and solar panels (all components derived, manufactured or refined from fossil fuels).
Accordingly, many claims about eliminating our use of fossil resources are wholly illusory.
However, in order to provide a better understanding of some of your claims regarding our nation’s
dependence on these resources, other than counting intermittent electricity generation as a product,
please provide a comprehensive list of all the things that are a product or can be manufactured out
of sunlight and wind (again, please exclude electricity).

Having served on the boards of DuPont and ConocoPhillips, I am well that fossil fuels
provide inputs and raw material for purposes other than generating electricity and will
likely continue to do so.

i have no comprehensive list at my disposal of products from sunlight or wind though i
would note that humans depend on sunlight as do other species, including plants — sea
grasses essential for fisheries; trees that provide lumber, fruit, mulch, seeds, wildlife
habitat, water filtration; and, of course, food crops. Communities around the Andes and
the Himalayas rely on the sun melting glaciers for drinking water —~ at least as long as
the glaciers remain,

Page 121

10. Please explain the process of photosynthesis.

I refer you to Wikipedia, which has a good explanation:

“Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light
energy, normally from the sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to
fuel the organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate
molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water
—- hence the name photosynthesis….in most cases, oxygen is also released as a
waste product. Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform
photosynthesis, and such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis
maintains atmospheric oxygen levels and supplies all of the organic compounds
and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.

Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process
always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction
centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments. In plants, these proteins are
held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells,
while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane, in these light-
dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable
substances such as water, producing oxygen gas. Furthermore, two further
compounds are generated: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the "energy currency" of
cells...

The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary
history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or
hydrogen sulfide as sources of electrons, rather than water. Cyanobacteria
appeared later, and the excess oxygen they produced contributed to the oxygen
catastrophe, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. Today, the
average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130
terawatts, which is about six times larger than the current power consumption of
human civilization, Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100~115
thousand million metric tonnes of carbon into biomass per year.”

11. Are there any other “pollutants” regulated under the Clean Air Act that are necessary to the
process of photosynthesis?

Not that I am aware of.
Page 122

12. How many parts per million (ppm) do humans inhale of C02 when they breathe? How many
ppm do humans exhale when they breathe?

i do not have this information handy.

13. Of all the “pollutants” regulated by the Clean Air Act and EPA, please provide a list of all those
humans exhale at a greater rate than they inhale and at what rate in ppm are they exhaled.

l’m not aware that humans exhale any of the 6 criteria air pollutants covered under the
clean air act, though substantial research has confirmed that breathing in sulfur dioxide,
carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxide, ozone, or particulates are not good for anyone’s
health.

14. While you were Administrator in 1992, you commissioned an Expert Panel on the Role of
Science at EPA to help identify how EPA could meet the goal of using sound science as the
foundation for the Agency’s policy and program decisions. The Panel reported to you that
“EPA science is of uneven quality, and the Agency’s policies and regulations are frequently
perceived as lacking a strong scientific foundation.” it also found that “the Agency is perceived
to have a conﬂict of interest because it needs science to support its legal activities.” EPA has
made little progress in becoming a source of unbiased scientific information over the years. Did
you implement the recommendations made by the Panel to ensure the EPA made all regulatory
decisions based on sound, peer-reviewed science? Do you believe the EPA has fully embraced
all of these suggestions and committed itself to basing its actions on sound science and
transparency?

From the time I was named EPA Administrator, I put a high priority on science in the
agency. The Reducing Risk report was intended to help better align the EPA budget
with the most serious risks.

The expert panel cited was also an attempt to improve the agency‘s scientific
capabilities. i learned at the start that Administrators do not always have all the
information at hand one would like, Budget constraints, gaps in data and scientific
understanding, incomplete risk assessments, inadequate testing or sampling
methodologies, and other factors can limit this information. Nonetheless, the laws or a
risk assessment often requires action. Weighing what you have to go on falls to the
Administrator.

Page 123

Since I left EPA in early 1993, l did not have the opportunity to see through the various recommendations.

As for EPA's science capabilities today, i am not close enough to observe internal
operations. I would note, however, that Bill Ruckelshaus was the first to remark that all
of EPA’s business is transacted in a fishbowl. There is no shortage of outside
stakeholders, reviewers, advocates, and the like.

1. Albert Einstein once famously stated that “the right to search for truth implies also a duty; one must not conceal
any part of what one has recognized to be true.” Do you agree with this statement?

a. In light of the Einstein quote, please answer the following questions based on
empirical evidence as well: as provide the source for your answer:

i. What are all the natural inﬂuences on our climate and which ones are we
able to control or not control?

While the Third National Climate Assessment (M) can be
referenced to address the entirety of the questions, some natural
influences on our climate include varying solar output from the sun,
volcanic eruptions, and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
Human factors are those we can control and include the emissions of
heat-trapping gases and particles as well as clearing of forests and
other land—use changes.

Additionally, the third NCA report explains that natural climate drivers
alone do not explain recent observed warming, and that over the last
half century the majority of the warming at the global scale can only
be explained by the effects of human influences, especially the
emissions from burning fossil fuels and from deforestation.

ii. For how long has the climate been changing and does climate change
predate the internal combustion engine?

Natural influences on our climate have been changing our climate
long before the invention of the internal combustion engine.
However, the scientific consensus from the nation’s climate experts
states in the third NCA that human activities have been the main
driver of climate change for the last half century

Page 124

iii. Have global average temperatures over the last 15 years been increasing,
decreasing, or stayed virtually the same?

According to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), global
average temperatures have increased 0.167°C over the last 15
years above the 20‘h century average — from 046°C above the 20th
century average in 1999 to 062°C above the 20th century average
in 2013. The NCDC also finds that 12 of the 13 warmest years on
record have occurred in the last 15 years.

iv. Has all climate change throughout earth’s geologic history been negative?

The ever-changing climate has positive and negative impacts to
people and the environment across regions around the world. The
rate at which the climate is changing, primarily from the emissions
of greenhouse gases and deforestation resulting from human
activities, is expected to result in negative impacts that will
outweigh positive impacts on a global scale. As stated in the latest
global assessment by the leading climate scientists around the
world according to the lPCC.

For example, the IPCC’s AR5 report states with high confidence
that “[g]lobally, positive impacts will be outweighed by the
magnitude and severity of negative impacts...”

The IPCC’s _AR_5 report also states with very high confidence that
“[r]ising sea levels and storm surges, heat stress, extreme
precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, drought and water
scarcity, and air pollution pose widespread negative risks for
people, health, livelihoods, assets, local and national economies,
and ecosystems..."

v. Over the last 100 years have hurricanes been increasing or decreasing in number and intensity?

According to the IPCC's ﬂ report, limited observation capabilities
have made it difficult to discern a trend in tropical cyclone activity
over the last century. However, the technological advancements
(e.g., the satellite era) have allowed for more comprehensive
observations since the 19705 and have revealed a robust increase
in the intensity and frequency of tropical systems in the North
Atlantic. The IPCC also states that projections for the 20th century

Page 125

indicate a warmer world will result in an increase in tropical cyclone
strength and associated rainfall.

vi. How does the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635 compare to the recent
history of hurricanes in the United States over the last 5 years?

The lack of observational capabilities in 1635 present Challenges in
documenting the Great Colonial Hurricane (GCH) of 1635, which
according to NOAA were mainly limited to the accounts of William
Bradford and John Winthrop, making a comprehensive assessment
extremely difficult for the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635,

Technological and scientific advancements have been exponential
since 1635, and assessments of tropical cyclones are now rigorous
and comprehensive. When only taking into account tropical
cyclones over the past 5 years that each cost the United States
more than $1 billion, NCDC estimates they caused nearly $80
billion in aggregate costs

 

v. What decade was the worst decade for drought in the United States?

According to Ephard Heim, a meteorologist and drought expert
with NCDC, "In terms of percent area of country affected by drought
(as measured by the Palmer Drought Index), the 1930‘s Dust Bowl
decade is the worst drought on record by spatial area."

According to Mpg, “[t]he ‘dust bowl’ effect was caused by
sustained drought conditions compounded by years of land
management practices that left topsoil susceptible to the forces of
the wind," meaning human activities played a role in the magnitude
of the drought.

vi. What decade was the worst decade for wildfires in the United States?

According to the third NCA report, “[s]easonal and multi-year
droughts affect wildfire severity, For example, persistent drought
conditions in the Southwest, combined with wildfire suppression
and land management practices, have contributed to wildfires of
unprecedented size since 2000. five western states (Arizona,
Colorado, Utah, California, and New Mexico) have experienced
their largest tires on record at least once since 2000. Much of the

Page 126

increase in fires larger than 500 acres occurred in the western
United States, and the area burned in the Southwest increased
more than 300% relative to the area burned during the 1970s and
early 1980s”

The third NCA report also states, “[dlrought and fire risk are
increasing in many regions as temperatures and evaporation rates
rise. The greater the future warming, the more these risks will
increase, potentially affecting the entire United States.“

ix. is the statement “What we do know is the temperature around the globe is
increasing faster than was predicted even ten years ago” an accurate
statement of global warming claims? Please provide the base source and by
what you are measuring for any supporting position.

According to NCDC, global average temperatures over the last 10
years have continued to rise. While the increase temperatures has
been at a rate more in-line with the lower end of some model
projections, additional warming to global temperatures will only
further enhance the risk we face from the impacts of climate
change in the United States and globally.

X. What is the current rate of sea level rise, and how does it compare to the
first and second halves of the twentieth century? What has been the
average rate of sea level rise since the last ice age?

According to the IPCC gas report, it is likely that global mean sea
level has accelerated since 1900. For a comprehensive and
detailed answer to your question, please reference the report,

xi. Please provide a list of the worst ten floods in world history based on human
impacts, including the country and date they occurred, and the number of
human lives lost.

National and international organizations like the National Climatic
Data Center and the World Meteorological Organization can likely
provide you with the answer to your question.

17.1 Please explain your exact role in the 2007 buyout of TXU.

Page 127

a. Were you ever involved in the negotiations to cancel coal fired power plants?
b. What environmental groups did you bring to the table for negotiations?

c. Did any money exchange hands with any environmental groups as part of this
negotiation or were any promises made to contribute to any environmental groups?

d. According to a May 2, 2014 article in the Washington Post, “A lot of banks and big
investors got burned in the bankruptcy last week of Energy Future Holdings, a
Texas electric utility that in 2007 had been acquired for $45 billion in one of the
largest leveraged buyouts ever. But the private—equity folks who put the deal
together, thanks to fees and tax deductions, will walk away virtually unscathed and
possibly slightly ahead.”

i. How did your personal financial situation change as a result of this
bankruptcy?

ii. What was the exact financial impact to you personally as a result of the 2007
negotiations (how much were you paid), what was your stake in the
company, and how did that stake change between 2007 and the 2014
bankruptcy?

iii. How has your thinking on shale gas changed as a result of this bankruptcy?

e. The same Washington Post article reported that “One set of players managed to
walk away in decent shape: the private—equity firms that engineered the buyout in
the first place.”

i. How much was your firm paid in this transaction, and was your
compensation at all based on negotiations with the environmental
community to terminate coal

I have served as a Senior Advisor to TPG Capital and in that capacity led the
negotiations in the TXU transaction on environmental commitments with EDF
and NRDC. We agreed to a suite of environmental priorities and commitments,
including a reduction in planned coal-fired power plants of 8 in Texas and 3 in
other deregulated states. Neither environmental group received compensation or
a promise of future compensation from TPG.

l have served throughout the period since the negotiations and purchase as a
member of the board of Energy Future Holdings for which I was compensated
$250,000 per year, half in shares now of doubtful value and half in cash. I was
awarded compensation following the transaction which principally took the form
of carried interest in the anticipated profit of the company in the event of a future
sale. As a result of the bankruptcy there are no such profits and I will receive no
carried interest.

Although the shale gas boom with its resulting low gas price has been

Page 128

responsible for the bankruptcy of EFH, it has been a boon to the U.S. economy
and environment. Done right it can continue to benefit consumers and reduce
C02 emissions

Since I was an advisor, I had no responsibility for nor access to TPG accounts.

18. What years were you affiliated with the World Wildlife Fund?

a. What was your salary while serving on the WWF Board?

I served as President of WWFUS from 1985 until i was sworn in as EPA Administrator
in 1989. I served on the WWF Board of Directors after leaving EPA in 1993, including
two terms as board chairman. I remain on the board as Chairman Emeritus

WWF does not compensate directors; indeed, it works the other way: directors typically
contribute to the organization.

1. What do you think should be the role of nuclear power in America’s generating mix?

I consider nuclear power a significant, indeed essential, part of the country’s electricity
generation i say this with full appreciation that a new large, multi-reactor plant can cost
in the range of $12 to $14 billion or more, prompting the former CEO of Exelon, the
utility with the largest nuclear fleet, to comment that was the market capitalization of his
entire company and he would not be willing to bet his company on such a costly
undertaking.

Add to this challenge the matter of waste disposal and the United States’ clear security
interest in preventing nuclear proliferation.

That is one reason I‘m intrigued by the prospect of small scale reactors. Less costly and
suitable for deployment on installations, campuses, industrial parks and in combination
with micro grids.

Their deployment is some years off, I believe, and thus we need to look at means of
ensuring that current nuclear plants can continue to contribute to meeting the country’s
energy demand, with safety in mind, of course. I’ve been impressed with the Institute
for Nuclear Power Operations’ ability to improve performance continually.
