The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. in room

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. The hearing of the EPW Subcommittee on 
Clean Air and Nuclear Safety will come to order. 
We will have opening statements from the members limited to 5 
minutes each followed by introduction and swearing of the wit-
nesses, followed by the testimony of the witnesses. I know that 
Ranking Member Sessions will be joining us later. I would like to 
thank him and members of the subcommittee and our witnesses for 
being here today to discuss the need to act on carbon pollution and 
climate change. 

We are privileged to have before our subcommittee four former 
Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency. All of 
them solved contentious environmental problems during their ten-
ures working for Republican presidents. Now they are banding to-
gether to bring attention to the biggest environmental threat of all, 
climate change. 

In a New York Times op-ed written last year, that I would like 
to enter into the record, without objection, these former Adminis-
trators stated, ‘‘We have a message that transcends political affili-
ation. The United States must move now on substantive steps to 
curb climate change at home and internationally.’’
