Wednesday, June 18, 2014 

## U.S. SENATE, COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS, 
## SUBCOMMITTEE ON CLEAN AIR AND NUCLEAR SAFETY, 
## Washington, DC. 

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. in room 
406, Dirksen Senate Building, Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse (chairman 
of the subcommittee) presiding. 
Present: Senators Whitehouse, Cardin, Sanders, Markey, 
Gillibrand, Booker, Sessions, Barrasso, Crapo, Boozman, Inhofe 
and Vitter. 

## OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, 
## U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. The hearing of the EPW Subcommittee on 
Clean Air and Nuclear Safety will come to order. 
We will have opening statements from the members limited to 5 
minutes each followed by introduction and swearing of the wit-
nesses, followed by the testimony of the witnesses. I know that 
Ranking Member Sessions will be joining us later. I would like to 
thank him and members of the subcommittee and our witnesses for 
being here today to discuss the need to act on carbon pollution and 
climate change. 

We are privileged to have before our subcommittee four former 
Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency. All of 
them solved contentious environmental problems during their ten-
ures working for Republican presidents. Now they are banding to-
gether to bring attention to the biggest environmental threat of all, 
climate change. 

In a New York Times op-ed written last year, that I would like 
to enter into the record, without objection, these former Adminis-
trators stated, ‘‘We have a message that transcends political affili-
ation. The United States must move now on substantive steps to 
curb climate change at home and internationally.’’

A Republican Case for Climate Action

By WILLIAM D. RUCKELSHAUS LEE M. THOMAS, WILLIAM K. REILLY and CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN

EACH of us took turns over the past 43 years running the Environmental Protection Agency. We served Republican presidents, but we have a message that transcends political affiliation: the United States must move now on substantive steps to curb climate change, at home and internationally.

There is no longer any credible scientific debate about the basic facts: our world continues to warm, with the last decade the hottest in modern records, and the deep ocean warming faster than the earth’s atmosphere. Sea level is rising. Arctic Sea ice is melting years faster than projected.

The costs of inaction are undeniable. The lines of scientific evidence grow only stronger and more numerous. And the window of time remaining to act is growing smaller: delay could mean that warming becomes “locked in.”

A market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be the best path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, but that is unachievable in the current political gridlock in Washington. Dealing with this political reality, President Obama’s June climate action plan lays out achievable actions that would deliver real progress. He will use his executive powers to require reductions in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the nation’s power plants and spur increased investment in clean energy technology, which is inarguably the path we must follow to ensure a strong economy along with a livable climate.

The president also plans to use his regulatory power to limit the powerful warming chemicals known as hydrofluorocarbons and encourage the United States to join with other nations to amend the Montreal Protocol to phase out these chemicals. The landmark international treaty. which took effect in 1989, already has been hugely successful in solving the ozone problem.

Rather than argue against his proposals, our leaders in Congress should endorse them and start the overdue debate about what bigger steps are needed and how to achieve them — domestically and internationally.

As administrators of the E.P.A under Presidents Richard M. Nixon. Ronald Reagan. George
Bush and George W. Bush, we held fast to common-sense conservative principles — protecting the health of the American people, working with the best technology available and trusting in the innovation of American business and in the market to find the best solutions for the least cost.

Page 3

That approach helped us tackle major environmental challenges to our nation and the world: the pollution of our rivers, dramatized when the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire in 1969; the hole in the ozone layer; and the devastation wrought by acid rain.

The solutions we supported worked, although more must be done. Our rivers no longer burn. and their health continues to improve. The United States led the world when nations came together to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals. Acid rain diminishes each year, thanks to a pioneering market-based emissions—trading system adopted under the first President Bush in 1990. And despite critics” warnings, our economy has continued to grow.

Climate change puts all our progress and our successes at risk. If we could articulate one
framework for successful governance, perhaps it should be this: When confronted by a problem, deal with it. Look at the facts, cut through the extraneous, devise a workable solution and get it done.

We can have both a strong economy and a livable climate. All parties know that we need both. The rest of the discussion is either detail, which we can resolve. or purposeful delay, which we should not tolerate.

Mr. Obama’s plan is just a start. More will be required. But we must continue efforts to reduce the climate-altering pollutants that threaten our planet. The only uncertainty about our warming world is how bad the changes will get, and how soon. What is most clear is that there is no time to waste.

The writers are former administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency: William D. Ruckelshaus, from its founding in 1970 to 1973, and again from 1983 to 1985; Lee M. Thomas from 1985 to 1989; William K. Reilly, from 1989 t0 1993; and Christine Todd Whitman, from 2001 to 2003.

Senator WHITEHOUSE. They are four in a large choir of voices 
singing the same tune on this issue. Major corporations are con-
cerned about climate change and have already started reducing 
their own emissions. The BICEP climate declaration is signed by 
more than 750 companies, including nameplate American brands 
like eBay, Gap, Levi, L’Oreal, Mars, Nike and Starbucks. 
The declaration states, in part, ‘‘We cannot risk our kids’ futures 
on the false hope that the vast majority of scientists are wrong. 
Leading is what we have always done and by working together, re-
gardless of politics, we will do it again.’’ I will enter a copy of that 
declaration into the record, without objection.

RE: Business Support for Proposed Carbon Pollution Standard for Existing Power Plants

Dear President Obama.

As businesses concerned about the immediate and long-term implications of climate change. we, the undersigned strongly support the principles behind the draft Carbon Pollution Standard for existing power plants released today. The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed Carbon Pollution Standard for existing power plants represents a critical step in moving our country towards a clean energy economy.

Our support is firmly grounded in economic reality. We know that tackling climate change is one of America's greatest economic opportunities of the 215' century and we applaud the EPA for taking steps to help the country seize that opportunity.

Our businesses represent many different sectors of the economy and we recognize the importance of flexibility in choosing a path that is most effective and efficient in meeting the goals we have each set within our respective companies. That is why we are pleased to see that EPA's proposed rule allows individual states to utilize a number of flexible strategies to comply with the proposed standard.

We are especially pleased to see an approach that catalyzes energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment. Clean energy policies are good for our environment. the economy, and companies. Increasingly, businesses rely on renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions to improve corporate performance and cut costs. In 2012. a study by Ceres. Calvert Investments and the World Wildlife Fund revealed that 60 percent of the combined Fortune 100 and Global 100 companies have set a renewable energy goal. a greenhouse gas reduction goal or both. In short. a majority of the world’s largest
companies are investing in clean energy and reducing emissions. Today’s rules will help spur investment and provide the long—term certainty necessary for our businesses to thrive and to meet these goals.

The new standards will reinforce what leading companies already know: climate change poses real financial risks and substantial economic opportunities and we must act now. We applaud your

administration for its commitment to tackling climate change and we encourage your timely pursuit of the finalization and implementation of these standards

Senator WHITEHOUSE. National defense leaders have sounded the 
alarm that climate change is a serious national security threat. 
There are also scientists, outdoorsmen, faith leaders, State and 
local officials and countless others demanding action. 

I understand that many of my colleagues are from States that 
depend on fossil fuels and have fossil fuel economies. They want to 
protect jobs in those industries. I get that and it is proper, but I 
also ask that they look at the other side of the ledger, the side of 
the ledger that affects States like Rhode Island. 

Our side of the ledger includes costs like damage to coastal 
homes, infrastructure and businesses from rising seas, erosion and 
storm surge, hospitalizations and missed school and work days for 
the families of kids suffering from asthma attacks triggered by 
smog, forests dying from beetle infestations and destroyed by un-
precedented wildfire seasons, farms ravaged by worsened drought 
and flooding. Our side of the ledger counts too. Do not pretend we 
do not exist. 

Recently, the EPA used its Clean Air authority as an established 
by Congress and affirmed by the Supreme Court to propose carbon 
pollution standards for the Country’s existing power plants. As pro-
posed, the rule will reduce carbon pollution while providing as 
much as $93 billion in public benefit per year by 2030. 

As you can see from this chart, a recent Washington Post, ABC 
News poll, found that 70 percent of the public supports Federal 
standards to limit greenhouse gas pollution. I am not sure if it is 
clear but the rightmost bar is Republicans who overwhelmingly 
support power plant regulations. 

Just this morning, the Wall Street Journal and an NBC news re-
leased polling data saying two-thirds of Americans support Presi-
dent Obama’s new climate rule and more than half said the U.S. 
should address global warming even if it means higher electric 
bills. 

The effects of climate change are apparent across our Country. 
At the Newport tide gauge, sea level is up almost 10 inches since 
the 1930’s. What do you think will happen when a hurricane as 
powerful as the devastating hurricane of 1938 rolls into the shores 
of Rhode Island on seas that are 10 inches higher? 

Louisiana is losing a football field of wetlands every hour due in 
part to sea level rise. According to measurements at NOAA’s Dol-
phin Island Station, sea level rise is up five inches along the Ala-
bama coast between 1966 and 2006. That is five more inches of 
ocean to batter Mobile Bay during storms. 

Then there is Florida, ground zero for climate change. In October 
2012, streets and homes in Hendricks Isle, Florida were flooded but 
not because of a storm. It all happened on a beautiful, sunny day. 
It was just extreme high tides pushed into the town by sea level 
rise. Climate change is a challenge we have a solemn duty to solve. 
Again, I thank the witnesses for joining us. The committee has 
much to learn from the collective experience of the former Adminis-
trators as we address this American challenge.
