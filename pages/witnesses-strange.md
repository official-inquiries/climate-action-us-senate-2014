Senator WHITEHOUSE. Next, we will hear from Attorney General 
Strange. Welcome, Attorney General. 

STATEMENT OF HON. LUTHER STRANGE, ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, STATE OF ALABAMA 

Mr. STRANGE. Thank, Mr. Chairman, Senator Sessions and mem-
bers of the committee for having me here today. I am pleased to 
be here to share my thoughts. 

As the Attorney General of Alabama, it is my sworn duty to up-
hold the rule of law for the almost 5 million people that we have 
in my State. That duty includes enforcing the environmental laws 
that help protect our natural resources and the health of our citi-
zens. 

One of the most important matters I am involved with now as 
attorney general is serving as the coordinating counsel for the Gulf 
States in the historic BP oil spill litigation. Alabama’s coastline 
was covered in oil and our economy was shut down for months as 
a result of the spill. 

I understand firsthand manmade environmental disasters and 
the importance of sensible and effective environmental regulations. 
With that said, my comments today reflect a continuing concern 
with this Administration’s approach to environmental regulation. 
The defense of this proposal will be that the States have ‘‘flexi-
bility.’’ Providing the States with a narrow range of costly policy 
choices, which most of the States did not choose for themselves, 
does not provide any actual flexibility and still produces the same 
outcome—higher electricity prices and decreased generation. 
Repeating over and over again the word ‘‘flexibility’’ is not an 
adequate defense or an adequate answer to the low income con-
sumers in my State or any other State, for that matter, who will 
ask why they must pay more to reduce CO2 emissions when those 
reductions cannot and will not impact the global climate. 
Congress did not intend for the Clean Air Act, Section 111(d) to 
have such a far reaching consequence for the American people. In-
deed, to prevent impacts such as those that will flow from EPA’s 
proposed emission guidelines, Congress took care to limit EPA’s au-
thority under Section 111(d). 

Given the enormous burdens that would be imposed by EPA’s 
proposed guidelines, however, it may be obvious that EPA has sim-
ply disregarded the limits of the law. These limits, moreover, are 
not questionable or controversial. They are expressed in clear ele-
ments of the Clean Air Act. 

First, the Clean Air Act forbids regulating sources under Section 
111(d) if they are regulated under Section 112 of the Act. Existing 
electric utility generating units are regulated under Section 112. 
Second, the Clean Air Act also forbids Section 111(d) regulations 
based on emission reductions that cannot be achieved at individual 
facilities but instead rely on reductions that require actions by an 
entire system. EPA’s proposed emission guidelines fully embrace a 
system-wide approach to regulation. 

Third, EPA has improperly attempted to limit Section 111(d)’s 
express statutory delegation of authority to the States and in doing 
so, EPA’s proposal not only rejects State discretion under the Clean

Air Act, but jettisons decades of unquestioned precedent estab-
lishing State jurisdiction over electricity markets. 
In conclusion, the State of Alabama vigorously opposes EPA’s 
proposed mandate to effectively restructure the electric sector as it 
would have disastrous consequences for electric reliability and the 
economy. Those consequences, moreover, would all stem from a 
patently unlawful application of the Clean Air Act. 

EPA’s proposal seeks to expand the scope of Section 111(d) in an 
unprecedented manner. It would do so at the expense of State au-
thority that is expressly identified and preserved in the Clean Air 
Act and in the unquestionable jurisdiction of States over intraState 
electricity markets. 

Finally, it would do all these things for no discernible benefit, 
given the increased emissions of China and other developing econo-
mies. There is no rationale that can support such regulation and 
this committee should ensure that it is halted.

“CLIMATE CHANGE: THE NEED 10 ACT Now”
SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT & PUBLIC WORKS
SUBCOMMITTEE 0N CLEAN AIR AND NUCLEAR SAFETY
JUNE 18, 2014

Testimony of Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange

Good morning, Chairwoman Boxer, Ranking Member Vitter, Subcommittee Chairman
Whitehouse, Ranking Member Sessions, and Members of the Committee. Thank you inviting
me to testify here today. My name is Luther Strange, and I am the Attorney General of
Alabama. As Attorney General, my sworn duty is to uphold the rule of law for the 4.8 million
hardworking men and women in my state. That duty includes enforcing the environmental laws
which help protect our natural resources and the health of our citizens. My comments today
reflect a continuing concern with this Administration’s approach to environmental regulation.
EPA’s proposed guidelines for existing power plant performance standards under Clean Air Act
section 111(d) are simply the most recent example of the Federal Government usurping
authorities properly delegated to the States.

Like electric suppliers all over the country, municipalities, cooperatives and investor-
owned utilities in Alabama are trying to come to grips with what this proposal will mean to
families and businesses in my state. Ultimately, someone has to pay for changing the way we
produce and use energy. If anyone suggests that these costs are minimal or worth it because of
the example that the United States will set, I would point out that setting an example in this
instance cannot by definition be free or cheap. On its face, the Administration’s proposal would
force electric suppliers to: 1) spend more for efficiency projects that are not economic, 2) deploy
renewable energy projects that do not meet normal cost-benefit standards, 3) limit the amount of
electricity used by customers through demand management efforts that do not meet standard cost
tests. 4) operate gas plants out of economic order in a way that was never envisioned before the
proposal, and 5) deny consumers access to lower cost coal plants—that were paid for through
current low rates—in ways that no one ever envisioned before the proposal.

The proposal goes to great lengths to disguise or minimize the negative economic, social,
and reliability impacts that it will have. Even the Administration’s own estimates, however, are
shocking-65,000 megawatts of generation will be closed prematurely; 6,000 megawatts will
close in my region; annual compliance costs will be between $7.5 billion and $9 billion and
rising; southern region electric prices will increase by 3.4 percent by 2020 and nationwide by 6.5
percent. Recent history, moreover, has shown that EPA is likely to have underestimated these
already severe impacts. During the MATS rulemaking, for instance, EPA told the nation that
only 5,000 megawatts of coal-fired electric generation would be retired. Ten times that amount
has been announced—some 50,000 megawatts. To put this in perspective, between the MATS
actual impact and EPA’s low ball assessment of this proposal, America will shutter generation
resources that exceed the electricity output of the entire nation of Spain. Early forced closure of
existing generation has to have cost impacts—low-cost generation is closed, more costly
generation remains, and customers must pay more for electricity. The result is inescapable and
intended. Even the President acknowledged that electricity prices must “skyrocket" in order to
implement his climate policies. I believe the President. I disagree with his policies.

Page 176

The defense of this proposal will be that the States have “flexibility,” but providing the
States with a narrow range of costly policy choices, which most of the States did not choose for
themselves, does not provide any actual flexibility and still produces the same outcome—higher
electricity prices and decreased generation. Repeating over and over the word “flexibility” is not
an adequate defense or adequate answer to the low-income consumers in my state, or any other
state, who will ask why they must pay more to reduce C02 emissions when those reductions
cannot and will not impact the global climate. '

In reaching this conclusion, I have given the President‘s proposal the benefit of its own
analysis. The US Chamber of Commerce, however, may be closer to the mark when it
predicted that the compliance costs for these regulations will be nearly $480 billion by 2030. or
$28 billion a year by 2030. That is three times the EPA estimates. Electricity is a force
multiplier, rising electric costs damage Gross Domestic Product. The Chamber says the loss will
be $50 billion a year, peaking at over $100 billion in 2025. This would mean a typical family in
my State would lose approximately $3,400 in disposable income, which would affect poor
families disproportionately. I am unwilling to transfer to a federal environmental agency the
indirect, but undeniable, power to reshape my State‘s energy portfolio and choices at the expense
of the hardworking families of Alabama.

Congress did not intend for Clean Air Act section l11(d) to have such far-reaching
consequences for the American people. Indeed, to prevent impacts such as those that will flow
from EPA’s proposed emission guidelines, Congress took care to limit EPA’s authority under
section it 1(d). Given the enormous burdens that would be imposed by EPA’s proposed
guidelines, however, it may be obvious that EPA has simply disregarded the limits of the law.
These limits, moreover, are not questionable or controversial; they are express and clear
elements of the Clean Air Act. As I will explain, the Clean Air Act forbids regulating sources
under section 11 1(d) if they are regulated under section 112 of the Act. Existing electric utility
generating units are regulated under section 1 12. The Clean Air Act also forbids section 11 1(d)
regulations that are based on emission reductions that cannot be achieved at individual facilities
but that instead rely on reductions that require actions by an entire system, including facilities
acting in tandem, state governments, and even electricity consumers. EPA’s proposed emission
guidelines fully embrace a system-wide approach to regulation. EPA has also improperly
attempted to limit section 111(d)’s express statutory delegation of authority to the States, and, in
doing so, EPA’s proposal not only rejects state discretion under the Clean Air Act but jettisons
decades: of unquestioned precedent establishing state jurisdiction over electricity markets. For
each of these reasons. EPA’s proposed emission guidelines must be stopped before they do
lasting damage to the Clean Air Act, the States, and the Nation.

The Clean Air Act Prohibits Regulation of Electric Generating Units Under Section 111(d)

As a threshold matter, the Clean Air Act is abundantly clear that EPA has no authority to
issue this proposal. As explained in a June 6, 2014 letter from West Virginia Attorney General

Page 177

Patrick Morrisey to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy,[1] section 11 1(d) expressly states that
EPA is prohibited from regulating any air pollutant emitted from an existing source category that
is regulated under section 1 12 of the Clean Air Act.[2] EPA has imposed extensive regulations on
existing coal- and natural gas-fired power plants pursuant to section 112, thereby precluding
regulation of these sources under section 111(d). EPA itself has conceded that “a literal reading"
of section 1 11(d) prohibits its proposed 1 11(d) guidelines for existing electric generating units,
but claims an ill-defined right to fundamentally reinterpret the statute.[3] As a state Attorney
General, I believe the law is what the law says, and I am troubled by EPA‘s belief that it can “fill
in the blanks” in a statute when there are no blanks to fill.

The Clean Air Act Does Not Allow 111(d) Standards That Apply “Beyond the Fence—line”

Even if EPA had the authority to issue this proposal, EPA’s proposed emission guidelines
flout fundamental statutory requirements in section 1 1 1(d). At the most basic level, the Clean
Air Act demands that any standards of performance issued by States pursuant to section
111(d)—and any emission guidelines that EPA issues to inform the development of state
standards—represent emission limits reflecting “best system of emission reduction” (“BSER”)
that has been adequately demonstrated for the existing source.[4]

Specifically. section 1 1 1(d) plainly states that the EPA Administrator is to establish a
procedure, including emission guidelines. under which each State prepares and submits “a plan
which establishes standards of performance fi)r any existing source for any air pollutant.”[5]
Further, the Act defines “stationary source" as “any building, structure, facility, or installation
which emits or may emit any air pollutant.”[6] The clear import of these provisions is that 111(d)
standards must be based on the emission reductions that individual sources can achieve by
controlling their own emissions.

The US. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has confirmed that 111(d)
standards must be emission control obligations that can be applied to “a single building,
structure, facility, or installation—the unit prescribed in the statute” and that EPA cannot re-
write the Clean Air At to apply a 11 1(d) standard to “a combination of such units.”[7]

Accordingly, a l 1 l (d) standard of performance can only be based on emissions
reductions that are demonstrated and achievable at individual emitting facilities—here, CO;
reductions that can be achieved at existing coal- and natural gas-fired electric generating units.
In other words, a standard of performance must be based on emission reductions “inside the

fence-line” of a facility. EPA’s proposed 1 1 l(d) guidelines are based on reductions achievable
“beyond the fence—line" and are, therefore, inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

EPA has proposed to conclude that four “building blocks” of measures are the “best
system of emission reduction” for controlling C02 at existing electric generating units. Those
four categories, which EPA calls “building blocks.” are:

(l) Efficiency requirements at coal and natural gas fired electric
generating units;

(2) Substituting generation from the most carbon intensive electric
generating units with generation from less carbon intensive units;

(3) Substituting generating from coal and natural gas-fired electric
generating units with generation from zero-carbon renewable
generation; and

(4) Using demand-side efficiency measures to reduce the total
amount of generation that its needed by consumers.

Building blocks 2, 3, and 4 all depend on C02 emission reductions that can only be
achieved when multiple facilities are operated as a coordinated system. C03 emission reductions
would be achieved under these building blocks, for instance, though emission averaging,
allowance trading, demand-side reductions, and re-dispatching generation from one facility to
another. This approach would effectively regulate the entire category of existing electric
generating units as a single source and base the “standards of performance" on the emission
reductions that arguably might be achievable by the category as a whole, rather than basing
standards on reductions demonstrated and achievable at individual sources. This “beyond the
fence-line” approach to setting 1 11(d) standards is inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and is in
direct violation ofD.C. Circuit's holding in ASARCO v. EPA.

Further, even building block 1—imposing efficiency improvement requirements at coal—
and natural gas- tired electric generating units—violates Clean Air Act requirements. The Clean
Air Act requires that “standards of performance" be “achievable” on a continuous basis by the
facilities regulated under section 111(d), Standards of performance for existing electric
generators based on one—size-fits-all efficiency improvements cannot be “achievable.” The
results possible at individual sources differ wildly: some units may be able to achieve
meaningful efficiency gains; others that are already highly efficient will not be able to further
enhance their efficiency. Evert at individual sources. measures to improve efficiency often
degrade over time, so that the source may not be able to demonstrate the same emission levels
continuously. Moreover, the emission impacts of efficiency improvements are exceedingly
difficult to measure, and if a source is used to its full capacity, there will by definition be no
absolute reduction in emissions. Thus, it is not feasible or consistent with the Clean Air Act to
prescribe or enforce a “standard of performance” based on efficiency improvements for existing
electric generating units.

Page 179

Additionally, undertaking efficiency improvements at a power plant could potentially
incite other regulatory requirements. In the past, EPA and environmental groups have filed
lawsuits alleging that power plant efficiency improvements triggered additional obligations
under the Act’s onerous “New Source Review" program. The potential for additional liability
will have a chilling effect, reducing the availability of compliance options.[8]

EPA’s building block approach to establishing 111(d) guidelines is not only unlawful, it
is inscrutable and onerous. EPA has an obligation to promulgate its guidelines through an open
and transparent process. Unfortunately, EPA has failed to meet that obligation, as this
complicated building block analysis results in complex calculations based on unfounded
technical assumptions that are not adequately explained anywhere in the record. Although my
staff and I are still in the process of unpacking this byzantine analysis, even a cursory review of
the measures required to meet my state’s emissions target is shocking. According to EPA’s
model, by 2030 Alabama would need to eliminate over 20% of its affordable and reliable coal-
fired generation; increase generation from more intermittent renewable energy sources over five—
fold; and expand nuclear generation by over 2.3 million megawatt-hours. These draconian
requirements, built on such a flimsy legal foundation, are a grave abuse of regulatory authority.

The Proposed 111(d) Guidelines Unlawfully Disregard State Authority

The proposed 111(d) guidelines’ substantive shortcomings are compounded by
significant procedural failures that undermine the role of the States under the Clean Air Act.
However, as noted in an analysis sent to EPA from a bipartisan group of 17 Attorneys General,
including myself, the proposal would, in fact, upend the Act’s deliberate division of regulatory
authority between the States and the Federal Government.[9]

At its heart, the Act relies on the principle of “cooperative federalism” and establishes
clearly defined roles for both EPA and the States that recognize that “air pollution control at its
source is the primary responsibility of States and local governments.”lo Cooperative federalism
embodies the values enshrined in the Tenth Amendment to the US. Constitution, which declares
that those powers “not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to
the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” It also reflects the inherent
wisdom of entrusting authority to the level of government that is closest to regulated sources, is
most familiar with local operating conditions, and is most sensitive to local costs and impacts to
consumers and businesses. Yet EPA‘s proposed emission guidelines depart radically from this
fundamental principle and, if finalized, would expand EPA’s authority far beyond the bounds of
the Clean Air Act.

Section 111(d) unambiguously grants States the sole authority to decide what standards
will apply to existing sources and only provides a limited role for EPA — a role the Agency has

10 Clean Air Act § 101(a)(3).

Page 180

plainly overstepped here. The Act merely authorizes EPA to “establish a procedure” for States
to submit plans establishing standards of performance for existing sources.[11] Clearly, EPA’s role
in regulating existing sources is purely procedural: the Agency has no authority to establish the
substantive requirements to be imposed. It is States that establish the applicable emission
standards. EPA’s implementing regulations allow the Agency to promulgate an “emission
guideline" setting forth “criteria for judging the adequacy” of state plans, but these guidelines do
not impose any substantive obligations on States or existing sources.[12]

Section 111(d) requires that the procedure for submitting these state plans must be similar
to section 110’s procedure for submitting state implementation plans, or “SIPs.” implementing
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. It is important that Congress used this analogy,
because it highlights the substantial discretion States can exercise in designing their plans for
existing sources and EPA’s limited ability to second-guess that discretion. Nearly 40 years ago,
the US. Supreme Court held in Union Electric Co. v. EPA that the Agency must approve a, SIP if
the State has accounted for all of the relevant statutory requirements. even if EPA disagrees with
the State’s choice of emission limits.[13] More recently. the fifth Circuit repeated that “the Act
confines the EPA to the ministerial function of reviewing SIP’s for consistency with the Act’s
requirements.”[14]

In that vein, section 111(d) limits EPA to the “ministerial function” of approving state
plans for existing sources as long as the State has considered the appropriate statutory
requirements—4n this case, the factors listed in section 111(a)(1)to set its “standards of
performance.” That provision states that standards of performance must be “achievable” for
individual sources through the application of the “best system of emission reduction” that has
been adequately demonstrated, and must account for costs, energy requirements. and other
environmental impacts.[15] Under 111(d). it is the States— not EPA — that are authorized to
establish emission standards; therefore it is the States — and not EPA—that weigh these statutory
factors to determine what standard is appropriate for existing sources. As with the SIPs, EPA
cannot use its emission guidelines to dictate the substance of the standards in state plans; it can
only require that States adopt performance standards that are based on the application of the
statutory factors.

EPA's proposed emission guidelines for greenhouse gases bear no resemblance to the
CAA‘s legal framework or to any of EPA’s previous 111(d) rulemakings. Instead of recognizing
State authority and expertise, EPA has relegated States to implementing a federal mandate
handed down from Washington, regardless of its costs, effectiveness, or achievability in light of
local circumstances. Despite the Agency‘s numerous public claims to have incorporated
“flexibility" into its unprecedented approach, EPA’s proposal actually denies States the
flexibility that section 111(d) mandates and that the States have historically exercised.

Page 181

For example, the Clean Air Act explicitly allows States to consider “the remaining useful
life” and “other factors” within the State’s discretion in order to tailor standards to individual
sources.[16] Likewise, States are free to determine that a specific source or group of sources
should be subject to a less stringent standard or longer compliance schedule because of costs,
physical limitations on installing control equipment, or any other factor making a less stringent
standard more reasonable.[17]

But under the proposed emission guidelines, EPA is attempting to strip that discretion
from the States. The Agency makes clear that under its approach. any State plan that does not
match the target emission rate chosen by EPA will be rejected. And because the target rates rely
on the exercise of all the State’s tools, no discretion remains. Putting aside the lack of any
language in the Clean Air Act authorizing EPA to establish mandatory emission guidelines, by
proposing a single state-wide emission rate for existing sources. the Agency is eliminating
States” inherent ability to adjust their plans to account for costs, achievability, aging sources, or
any of the other myriad factors a state may rely on to perform its statutory role of establishing
emission standards. Each State’s proposed target subsumes all existing sources under one
emission rate, preventing any meaningful sub-categorization or individualization of standards: a
State cannot reduce the burden on one source (as section 111(d) allows it to do) without
increasing the burden on others. Given that EPA’s proposed targets appear to be unachieveably
high at the outset, depriving States of their ability to account for local impacts will only
exacerbate the destructive consequences of EPA’s guidelines for consumers and for the
economy. EPA should abandon its attempt to usurp the role of the States.

The Proposed 111(d) Guidelines Would Displace Traditional State Control of Electricity
Markets

The proposed 111(d) guidelines also undermine State roles in policy areas well outside
the Clean Air Act. For nearly a century. States have enjoyed substantial flexibility to oversee the
generation and distribution of electricity within their borders. This autonomy flows from the
Federal Power Act’s recognition that State and federal authorities occupy distinct and separate
spheres with regard to the regulation of electricity. Specifically. the Federal Power Act broadly
limits federal regulations “only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the
States." Thus, the Federal Government may exercise jurisdiction over the transmission of
electricity in interstate commerce. as well as wholesale sales of electricity in interstate
commerce.[18] As recently as last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit reaffirmed that, absent a “clear and specific grant of jurisdiction.” the Federal
Government cannot regulate areas of the electricity market left by the Federal Power Act to the
States.

18 l6 U.S.C. § 824(a) and (b). Consistent with the scope of this express statutory authorization, it has been
recognized that the Federal Power Act permits regulation of unbundled sales of transmission in a state, even when
such sales are at retail. See New York v. FERC. 535 U.S. l (2002).

19 Electric Power Supply Association v. FERC. No, 1 l-l486 at 9 (DC. Cir, May 23, 2014).

Page 182

EPA claims its outside the fence—line approach offers States flexible options to implement
the proposed 111(d) guidelines. What EPA calls “flexibilities”—changing dispatch rules,
mandating efficiency, utilizing other generation sources—are, in fact, the very intrastate
generation, transmission, and distribution matters explicitly reserved by the Federal Power Act
for the States. By requiring States to meet standards based on these outside the fence-line
actions. the l 1 1(d) guidelines effectively upend the Federal Power Act‘s careful balance between
State and federal authority, subverting traditional State control of retail electricity matters with a
federal mandate to overhaul virtually every aspect of the intrastate electricity system. Thus, the
proposed 1 11(d) guidelines effectively replace the Federal Power Act’s co-regulatory model with
federal regulations, in EPA’s own words, “from plant to plug”20—»granting the Federal
Government powers denied it for nearly the entire history of the electricity grid. Since 1915, the
Alabama Public Service Commission has guided intrastate electricity development so as to
protect rate-payers and ensure reliability. Under EPA‘s proposed 111(d) guidelines, however,
the Commission could continue these efforts only in so much as they comport with EPA’s
greenhouse gas agenda.

Congress surely did not intend to undermine the entire Federal Power Act structure by
authorizing such expansive powers under the Clean Air Act—particularly under section 111(d),
where, as explained above, State and federal powers are so carefully tailored. Rather, this
provision can only be coherently read. both internally and externally, as contemplating measures
solely inside the fence-line of a designated facility. Indeed. while the proposed 1 l 1(d) guidelines
quote analysis questioning whether the division between inside and outside the fence-line
measures “arguably becomes irrelevant, at least from a legal perspective[,]”2' the Federal Power
Act’s express limitations make clear that this distinction is not without cause. By limiting ll 1(d)
to only those measures inside the fence-line of a designated facility. Congress constrained EPA
to the role of environmental protection and prevented the Agency from impinging on outside
policy matters like traditional electricity regulation. Ultimately, limits on federal power in both
the Federal Power Act and Clean Air Act section 111(d) are not legally irrelevant, but instead
reflect Congressional assent to the Tenth Amendment’s exhortation that "the powers not
delegated to the United States by the Constitution. nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved
to the States respectively. or to the people.”

Conclusion

The State ofAlabama vigorously opposes EPA’s proposed mandate to effectively
restructure the electric sector, as it would have disastrous consequences for electric reliability
and the economy. Those consequences. moreover, would all stem from a patently unlawful
application of the Clean Air Act. EPA’s proposal seeks to expand the scope of section 111(d) in
an unprecedented manner. It would do so at the expense of State authority that is expressly
identified and preserved in the Clean Air Act and in the unquestionable jurisdiction of States
over intrastate electricity markets. And it would do all of these things for no discernible benefit.
given the increasing emissions of China and other developing economies. There is no rationale
that can support such a regulation, and this Committee should ensure that it is halted.

Answers to Follow-up Questions for Alabama Attornev General Luther Strange

Question from Senator David Vitter

l. Attorney General Strange. last year, the Senate EPW Republicans released a report
entitled, “Neglecting a Cornerstone Principle of the Clean Air Act: President Obama's
EPA Leaves States Behind.” The report chronicles EPA’s increasing departure from the
cooperative federalism approach established in the Clean Air Act. When it comes to
EPA‘s implementation of the President’s Climate Action Plan, is it your opinion that
EPA is abiding by the cooperative federalism design of the Clean Air Act? ls EPA
seeking to cooperate with the States?

Answer: No, EPA is absolutely failing to abide by the Clean Air Act’s cooperative
federalism design. instead of seeking to cooperate or collaborate with the States as
Congress intended, EPA is attempting to unilaterally carry out a mandate from the
Executive Branch.

In enacting the Clean Air Act, Congress relied on the principle of cooperative federalism,
establishing clearly defined roles for both EPA and the States and recognizing that air
pollution control is the primary responsibility of States and local governments. As I
explained in my written testimony, EPA’s proposed implementation of the President’s
Climate Action Plan represents a radical departure from that fundamental principle, and if
finalized. would expand EPA‘s authority far beyond the bounds of the Clean Air Act.
EPA has clearly overstepped its limited role in Clean Air Act implementation. EPA is
authorized only to “establish a procedure" for States to submit plans establishing
standards of performance for existing sources: the Agency has no authority to establish
the substantive requirements to be imposed. It is States that establish the applicable
emission standards. But under EPA’s proposal. EPA attempts to divest that discretion
from the States.

EPA’s failure to abide by the Clean Air Act and recognize State authority and expertise
in implementing the President’s Climate Action Plan is the latest instance of EPA’S
repeated attempts to usurp States’ powers under the Act in the last several years. Often
springing from secretive “sue and settle" arrangements with environmental organizations
that exclude the States, EPA has again and again stripped States of their statutory powers
by revoking longstanding, well-accepted provisions of state implementation
plans (“SIP”) and imposing excessively stringent. costly, and even unachievable
standards.

Questions front Senator Jeff Sessions

1. Your testimony points out that EPAs Mercury and Air Toxics Standards will close
ten times more power plants than the Agency had projected — numbers supported by
analysis from DOE’s Energy Information Administration. Even the LA. Times said
EPA’s projections for that rule “turned out wrong almost immediately." In light of this
inaccurate history, can States credibly rely on EPA’s impact analysis for the proposed
existing power plant guidelines?

Answer: No, given EPA’s track record, States cannot reasonably rely on the agency’s
impact analysis for its proposal. EPA‘s wildly inaccurate estimates of the MATS Rule’s
effects are indicative of the great lengths the agency will go to in an attempt to conceal
the devastating impact its climate proposal will have on the economy, industry. and
electric reliability. Note that, as outlined in my written testimony, even EPA‘s own
(likely underestimated) predictions are alarming, but the (likely accurate) estimates of the
US Chamber of Commerce are downright terrifying and demand withdrawal of EPA’s
proposal. By the Chamber’s calculations, compliance costs by 2030 will be three times
greater than EPA has estimated.

2. Are you concerned that the proposed existing power plant guidelines could undermine
the ability of state utility commissions to protect rate-payers and ensure reliability? If so,
why?

Answer: Yes. Under the Federal Power Act, the States have considerable autonomy in
overseeing the generation and distribution of electricity within their borders. The Federal
Government may regulate only those aspects of the electricity market not designated for
regulation by the States under the Federal Power Act. But EPA’s proposal involves
requiring States to meet standards based on changes in the very intrastate generation,
transmission, and distribution matters that the Federal Power Act reserves for the States.
EPA’s effective seizure of States’ control over their own electricity systems would leave
utility commissions like the Alabama Public Service Commission without the ability to
guide intrastate electricity development unless their choices conform to EPA‘S
preferences with respect to the climate plan. This would impair States” ability to protect
rate-payers and ensure reliability, which could have disastrous economic consequences
for the States.

3. At the hearing, you were asked by Senator Boxer whether “Alabama lost all recent
major Clean Air Act cases" including legal challenges to the Cross-State Air Pollution
Rule, the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule (Utility MACT), and the endangerment finding
and light duty vehicle GI-lG tailpipe standards, I understand that Sen. Boxer’s question
may have over—simplified the legal posture and outcomes of those cases. Please
supplement your response so that the record is more complete on this topic.

Answer: Yes, I would like to clarify my response to Senator Boxer‘s question with
respect to the legal challenge to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (the Transport
Rule”). Although the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision indeed reversed and remanded the
decision of the D.C. Circuit to vacate the Transport Rule, there are multiple unresolved

Page 185

issues that the D.C. Circuit may consider on remand. While disagreeing that EPA’s
approach to defining what constitutes a “significant contribution to non attainment” was
facially invalid. the Supreme Court agreed with the D.C. Circuit that the Clean Air Act
precludes EPA from requiring reductions in upwind state emissions that are “more than
the amount necessary” to eliminate significant contributions to non attainment.
Furthermore, the Supreme Court’s decision recognized that States may bring
particularized challenges to the Transport Rule. Now that the case is once again before
the D.C. Circuit, Alabama and other States have requested the opportunity to address
those unresolved issues in supplemental briefing. Thus the case remains pending, and the
outcome is yet unknown.

1 would also like to clarify my response to Senator Boxer’s question with respect to the
legal challenge to the MATS Rule. Alabama and other parties have submitted a petition
for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the D.C. Circuit’s
decision upholding the rule. Thus, that case remains pending, as well
