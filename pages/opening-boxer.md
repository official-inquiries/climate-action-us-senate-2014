OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
Senator BOXER. Thank you, Senator. 

Thanks to your work, we are joined by an extraordinary panel. 
I thank all of you for being here. 

We are looking at four former Administrators of the EPA—this 
is really historic—who were appointed by Republican Presidents. 
The Honorable William Ruckelshaus served as the first EPA Ad-
ministrator under President Nixon and then again under President 
Reagan. The Honorable Lee Thomas served under President 
Reagan. The Honorable William Reilly served under President 
George H.W. Bush. The Honorable Christine Todd Whitman served 
under President George W. Bush. 

I am proud of our landmark environmental laws we created with 
an overwhelming bipartisan consensus. It saddens me more than I 
can ever express in words that protecting the environment at this 
Federal level has become an out and out war, a partisan issue. It 
should not be that way; it wasn’t when I started.

In 1970, the Clean Air Act passed the Senate by a vote of 73 to 
0, passed by the House by a vote of 375 to 1, was signed by Presi-
dent Nixon. In 1990, revisions to the Clean Air Act passed the Sen-
ate by a vote of 89 to 11, by 401 to 21 in the House and was signed 
into law by President George H.W. Bush. 

In the last Congress, the Republicans sent us over 90 anti-clean 
air riders. They are planning to do it now in the back rooms. They 
are working on plans to overturn President Obama’s action plan to 
cut back on carbon pollution. 

We all should know that we need to take action to reduce harm-
ful carbon pollution—97 percent of the scientists agree it is leading 
to dangerous climate change that threatens our families. To say we 
cannot have an opinion, as some of my Republican colleagues have 
done because they are not scientists—you heard them say it. 
Speaker Boehner said it. He said, I am not a scientist. I can’t say 
whether there is climate change. All the more reason to listen to 
a scientist if you are not a scientist. 

We all have health problems in our families and right here in the 
Senate. When doctors tell us we need a heart bypass or cancer 
treatment, we listen. We don’t just say, I am not a doctor, I am not 
going to listen. 

The four former EPA Administrators with us today will testify 
about the need to control carbon pollution to avoid the most calami-
tous impacts of climate change such as rising sea levels, dangerous 
heat waves and economic disruption. 
The American people certainly understand this threat. You saw 
the poll. It is extraordinary. Democrats, Republicans and independ-
ents support the President’s plan. 

As someone with a 95 percent labor record, I want to talk a 
minute about jobs. I want to welcome the people here who work 
with their hands because I respect the work that you do, but I 
want to say two things now. 

One, I want to put in the record the number of jobs in the coal 
industry under George W. Bush, the number of jobs in the coal in-
dustry under President Obama and there are more jobs under 
President Obama. There is a lot of talk around here but a lot of 
times we don’t look at the facts, so I will put this in the record with 
your permission.

Senator BOXER. I also want to say that I lived through all this 
fear mongering about jobs. Between 1970 and 2011, in 1970, we 
passed the Clean Air Act amendments. People were shouting, you 
are a job killer, you are a job killer. What happened? Air pollution 
dropped 68 percent saving our families’ health while the U.S. gross 
domestic product grew 212 percent. Private sector jobs increased by 
88 percent during that same period. 

These scare tactics have been tried before and they are just not 
real. When you look in my State and see the number of jobs that 
have been created as we moved to clean energy, it is very, very en-
couraging. 

Power plants account for 40 percent of all carbon pollution re-
leased into the air. Right now there are no limits to the amount 
of pollution that can be released, carbon pollution, from those 
power plants. 

This is what the President’s plan will do. It will avoid up to 6,600 
premature deaths, 150,000 asthma attacks, 3,300 heart attacks, 
2,800 hospital admissions and 490,000 missed days at school and 
work. 

I ask you, colleagues, when you go home, you speak to kids all 
the time. Ask them how many have asthma or know someone with 
asthma. Half the kids will raise their hands. Why would you attack 
a plan that will avoid so many heart attacks, asthma attacks, 
150,000 asthma attacks? 

It is in America’s DNA to turn a problem into an opportunity. 
Let us do it because I will tell you like many other jobs, you cannot 
outsource putting a solar roof on a home, you cannot outsource put-
ting a wind turbine in place. 

I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for his extraordinary leader-
ship. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. I am now pleased to recognize my friend 
from Wyoming, the distinguished Senator Barrasso.
