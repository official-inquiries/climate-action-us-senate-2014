Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you very much, Mr. Ruckelshaus. 
Governor Whitman. 
STATEMENT OF CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN, PRESIDENT, THE 
WHITMAN STRATEGY GROUP; FORMER GOVERNOR, STATE 
OF NEW JERSEY; AND FORMER ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. ENVI-
RONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 

Ms. WHITMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Rank-
ing Member Sessions for holding this hearing and allowing us this 
opportunity. 

I have to begin by expressing my frustration with the discussion 
about whether or not the Environmental Protection Agency has the 
legal authority to regulate carbon emissions that is still taking 
place in some quarters. 

The issue has been settled. EPA does have the authority. The 
law says so, the Supreme Court has said so twice. That matter, I 
believe, should now be put to rest. Given that fact, the agency has 
decided, properly in my view, that it should act now to reduce car-
bon emissions to improve the quality of our air, protect the health 
of our people and as part of an international effort to address glob-
al climate change. 

To the United States, climate change is not just an environ-
mental issue or an economic issue. Climate change also has very 
real implications for our national security. Those concerns must be 
an important part of any discussion that takes place. 

We all know that the earth’s climate is changing. We also know 
that human activity, although not solely responsible and we should 
freely acknowledge that, is both contributing to that change and in-
creasing the risks that we will push the environment beyond the 
point at which we can repair it. 

We should know that when one is contributing to a problem, one 
has an obligation to be a part of the solution of that problem. That 
is what the EPA is trying to do. 

There is, of course, honest disagreement about aspects of the 
agency’s power plant proposal, including whether or not it may be 
stretching its legal authority a bit too far in some parts of the pro-
posed rule. I am sure, however, that EPA will be made aware of 
all concerns during the comment period. 

My hope, however, is that the primary focus will be on the sub-
stance of the proposed rule and not EPA’s broad authority to pro-
mulgate it. That being said, it is clear that the Clean Air Act, as 
it now stands, is an imperfect tool to address the unique challenges 
that climate change presents. congressional action and leadership 
would be a preferable approach, but since Congress has declined to 
act, EPA must. That is the law. Action will not come without cost, 
but since President Nixon created the EPA in 1970, it has sought 
to carry out its mandate in a balanced way. 

Environmental protection and economic prosperity are not mutu-
ally exclusive goals. EPA has not always been able to reach a State 
of perfect equilibrium. I think we will all agree to that. It has, how-
ever, consistently struck a reasonable balance that protects both 
the health of the environment and the health of the economy. 
From 1980 to 2012, the total emissions in the United States of 
six common air pollutants dropped 67 percent. At the same time,

our population grew by 38 percent. Our energy consumption in-
creased by 27 percent and our GDP more than doubled in constant 
dollars. 

More people consuming more energy emitted much less pollution 
without sacrificing economic growth. That is clear evidence of the 
balance that EPA has been able to strike in the past. If the past 
is prologue, further reductions are both achievable and affordable. 
Mr. Chairman, my hope is that Congress will at long last ac-
knowledge that climate change is real, that humans are contrib-
uting to it, and that the potential consequences of inaction are far 
greater than the projected costs of action. 

We have specific and scientific consensus on this issue. What we 
need is political consensus. The two parties were able to rally 
around a common purpose in the early days of the modern environ-
mental policymaking. It is urgent that they do so again. 
Thank you very much.

Statement of the Honorable Christine Todd Whitman before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Washington, D.C.

June 18, 2014

Thank you, Mr. Chairman [Whitehouse] and Ranking Member Sessions for
the opportunity to appear before you this morning. it has been some time since 1
have appeared before a Senate committee. It's good to be with you.

I must begin by expressing my frustration that the discussion about whether
the Environmental Protection Agency has the legal authority to regulate carbon
emissions is still taking place, in some quarters.

The issue has been settled. EPA does have the authority. The law says so and
the Supreme Court has said so twice. The matter should be put to rest.

Given that fact, the Agency has decided — properly, in my view — that it should
act now to reduce carbon emissions to improve the quality of our air, protect the
health of our people, and as part of an international effort to address global Climate
change,

For the United States, climate change is not just an environmental issue or an
economic issue. Climate change also has very real implications for our national
security, and those concerns must be an important part of the discussion.

We all know, after all, that the earth‘s climate is changing. We also know that
human activity, although not solely responsible, as we should freely acknowledge, is
both contributing to that change and increasing the risk that we will push the
environment beyond the point at which we can repair it. And we should know that
when one is contributing to a problem one has an obligation to contribute to its
solution. That’s what the EPA is trying to do.

There is, of course, honest disagreement about aspects of the Agency's power
plant proposal, including whether it may be stretching its legal authority a bit too far
in some parts of the proposed rule. I’m sure, however, that EPA will be made aware
of any and all concerns during the comment period. But I hope the primary focus
will be on the substance of the proposed rule, and not EPA's broad authority to
promulgate it.

Page 91

That being said, it's clear that the Clean Air Act, as it now stands, is an
imperfect tool to address the unique challenges that climate change presents.
Congressional action and leadership would be a preferable approach. But since
Congress has declined to act, the EPA must.

Action will not come without cost. But since President Nixon created the EPA
in 1970, it has sought to carry out its mandate in a balanced way. Environmental
protection and economic prosperity are not mutually exclusive goals.

EPA has not always been able to reach a state of perfect equilibrium. it has,
however, consistently struck a reasonable balance that protects both the health of
the environment and the health of our economy.

To illustrate, from 1,980 to 2012, the total emissions in the United States of
six common air pollutants dropped by 67 percent. At the same time, our population
grew by 38 percent, our energy consumption increased by 27 percent, and our GDP
more than doubled, in constant dollars.

So more people, consuming more energy, emitted much less pollution
without sacrificing economic growth. That is clear evidence of the balance the EPA
has struck.

If the past is prologue, further reductions are achievable and affordable.

Mr. Chairman, my hope is that Congress will, at long last, acknowledge that
climate change is real, that humans are contributing to it, and that the potential
consequences of inaction are far greater than the projected costs of action.

We have a scientific consensus around this issue. We also need a political
consensus.

The two parties were able to rally around a common purpose in the early
days of modern environmental policymaking it is urgent that they do so again.

Thank you.

The Climate ls Changing. Republicans Need to Open Their Eye... Page 1 of 5

POLITICO/MAGAZINE

    
IN THE ARENA
The Climate Is Changing. Republicans
Need to Open Their Eyes Before It’s Too Late.

By CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN ‘ May 14, 2014

This week, two teams of scientists announced that the West Antarctic ice sheet has begun collapsing, beginning what they call an “unstoppable” process that could raise sea levels by as much as 15 feet over time. “This is really happening,” Thomas P. Wagner, one of the researchers, told the New York Times. “There’s nothing to stop it now.” The timing was especially unfortunate for Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican senator and 2016 hopeful, who had just cast doubt on

Page 93

The Climate ls Changing. Republicans Need to Open Their Eye... Page 2 of 5

the phenomenon of human—induced climate change, telling ABC News, “I do not believe that human activity is causing these
dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it.”

Rubio has expressed more reasonable positions on the topic in the past—and he quickly sought to clarify his remarks~but I do not
entirely blame him for his rhetorical shift. In an annual Pew poll,
only 14 percent of Republicans cited climate change as a top policy
priority. That’s down from 23 percent in 2007, the first year Pew
included climate change in its priority list. The party has clearly
changed in those seven years, and Rubio knows where his voting
base for 2016 is on the issue.

This is not simply a problem in the Republican Party, though. The
American public routinely ranks addressing climate change low on
its list of priorities for Washington. This year it ranked 19th among
20 issues tested by Pew, just behind “dealing with moral
breakdown" and “improving roads, bridges, public transit."

The climate issue is politically challenging not only because it’s at
the bottom of people’s priority lists, but also because of overreach on
both sides of the debate. Humans aren’t the sole “cause” of climate
change, and environmentalists have done a disservice in making
that claim too assertively. Our activities are exacerbating natural
phenomena, making us part of the problem, but the Earth and its
climate has been changing since it was formed. Because of human 
activity, things are changing faster than nature or humans can


Page 94


adapt, and the sooner we start taking steps to slow things, the better
off we will be.

The modern environmental movement arguably began with Teddy
Roosevelt, the Republican president who established the national
park system. A Republican president, Richard Nixon, and a
Democratic Congress created much of our landmark environmental
legislation, including the Clean Air Act and the establishment of the
Environmental Protection Agency. But Republicans have gotten
away from those values in recent years. The only way to return the
GOP to its roots and, in turn, make headway on climate change is by
ensuring that Republicans and all Americans—recognize the very
real economic costs of not protecting our environment.

Scientists have long predicted that one of the consequences of
climate change will be more frequent and more severe storms. They
can’t predict where and when they will occur, but the extreme
magnitude of them reflects climate change. We saw the destruction
wrought by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and I do not want anyone to
have to endure what citizens of the New Jersey and New York
coastlines experienced in that storm. Taking just my home state as
an example, New Jersey‘s 127 miles of sandy beaches contribute
approximately $20 billion in economic activity to New Jersey’s
economy. More frequent and more severe storms means more
homes and businesses destroyed, state economies blighted and of
course, most importantly, more lives lost. We simply cannot afford
to let that happen.

Page 95

And the climate’s not the only thing at stake here. Recent studies
linking various health and economic impacts of environmental
contamination should be enough to give any policymaker pause: the
connection between certain pesticides and Parkinson’s, the
correlation between elevated lead in gasoline with crime rates and
the finding that pregnant women who were exposed to high levels of
diesel particulates were twice as likely to have an autistic child. In
our necessary mission to grow the economy, we cannot neglect
environmental stewardship; the price we pay is much greater than
we can afford, both in terms of dollars and human lives.

This is no zero-sum game. In fact, the more our economy grows, the
better we ought to be able to protect the planet—and ourselves.
Recently economists have hypothesized what is called the
“environmental Kuznets curve," which shows that after a certain
point in a country’s development, GDP continues to grow even as
the level of environmental pollutants decreases. To use just one
example, between 1970 and 2006, U.S. GDP grew by 195 percent,
yet thanks to regulatory changes annual emissions of carbon
monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead all decreased significantly.

I remain confident that economic prosperity and environmental
protection are not mutually exclusive goals, and as soon as my party
recognizes the exorbitant economic costs of not acting on climate
change, I believe we will start to make progress. It is imperative that
Congress make this issue a priority. I only hope it’s not already too
late.

Environment and Public Works Committee Hearing
June 18, 2014

Follow-up Questions for Written Submission

Questions for Whitman

Questions from:
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse

1. Before many environmental regulations are applied, dire consequences and worst fear
outcomes are usually perpetuated. How did the worst fears and assumptions of bad
outcomes from environmental regulations turn out in reality as the rules were applied in
your own experience?

As i indicated in my testimony, environmental protection and economic growth can go hand
in hand. From 1980 to 2012, the total emissions in the United States of six common air
pollutants dropped by 67 percent. At the same time, our population grew by 38 percent,
our energy consumption increased by 27 percent, and our GDP more than doubled, in
constant dollars. As I mentioned at the hearing, one example during my tenure was the
regulation of diesel non-road engines. When we began the regulatory process, industry
complained that they couldn’t possibly meet the new, cleaner engine standards in the
timeframe proposed and that it would be very costly. As the process proceeded, one
company eventually came forward and said they could meet the new standards within the
timeframe. As the regulations went into effect, all of the companies were able to comply
without dire consequences, and significant clean air benefits have been achieved.

EPA has compiled on their website the costs and benefits of the various Clean Air Act
regulations at: http://www.epa.gov/cleanairactbenefits/economy.html

Questions from:
Senator Cory Booker
1. Governor Whitman, I appreciated your opening comments which recognized that 
environmental protection and economic prosperity are not mutually exclusive goals. Since
2009, the nine states participating in the regional cap-and-trade program known as RGGI

Page 98

have cut emissions by 18 percent, while their economies grew by nearly 9 percent during
that time period. I believe that New Jersey should re~join RGGI.

a. In light of the proposed new EPA power plant regulation which would give flexibility
to states in how to reduce emissions, do you believe that New Jersey should now
consider re-joining RGGI?

I will leave that decision to Gov. Christie.

2. From my research it seems that New Jersey is particularly vulnerable to the effects of
climate change. Not only are sea levels off the Jersey Coast expected to rise more than the
global average in coming years, but our coast is also slowly sinking over time. All of this
adds up to potentially catastrophic future flooding.

a. Is this consistent with your understanding of the threat climate change poses to New Jersey?

I would agree that, with 127 miles of beach front, New Jersey is certainly at
significant risk from sea level rise, but l'm not sure that it is more or less vulnerable

than other coastal states.

3. Governor Whitman, nationally we get about 20 percent of our electricity from nuclear
energy. But in New Jersey we get nearly 50% of our electricity from nuclear. As a carbon free source of base load power, do you see more nuclear energy as part
of the solution towards significant emissions reductions?

Yes

Questions from:

Senator David Vitter

1. Author and environmental activist Bill McKibben has written that “You can have a healthy
fossil-fuel industry or a healthy planet, but you can’t have both.”

Do you agree with this statement?

No. This is not an either/or situation. As we have seen from other resource and
environmental challenges, there is great potential in new technology that will allow us
to use responsibly such resources even as we move to a low~carbon economy.

2. Mr. McKibben has also written that ”one way to fight the power of fossil fuel companies] is to
stop using fossil fuel."

Page 99

Do you think this is realistic for consumers, in light of the fact that, as the International
Energy Agency noted, “Despite all the attention given to renewable energy, fossil fuels
still produce about four—fifths of the energy consumed worldwide?" Moreover, by 2050,
the IEA projects that, even with its most aggressive carbon reduction scenario, fossil
fuels would still provide 45 percent of global energy demand. Do you agree with this
projection? More broadly, do you agree that, even as countries take steps to reduce
carbon emissions, fossil fuels will continue to comprise a substantial portion of the
global energy mix in the coming decades?

I agree that fossil fuels make up a substantial part of our energy mix and will continue to
do so for some time. My hope is that we can migrate to cleaner sources of power over
time, such a nuclear power and renewable energy, and can increase our efforts at
conservation and efficiency. Within the fossil fuels, natural gas is cleaner than coal and
can be an important fuel, particularly in the nearer term, and hopefully we can
transition to cleaner coal as the technology becomes available/affordable.

3. Mr. McKibben has written that a "huge problem with increased reliance on cheap natural gas: it
undercuts that transition to zero-carbon energy sources like solar and wind power, locking us
into long»term reliance on fossil fuels."

Do you agree with this statement? Do you believe that "reliance on cheap natural gas"
has been harmful or helpful to the U.S. economy, particularly for consumers and manufacturers?

I do not agree; I do not think it is an either/or proposition. We can use more natural gas
while also increasing our use of renewables, Overall, natural gas has been helpful to our
country since much of it is domestically produced, and it has allowed for the reduction
in coal use. We need to be careful not to over-invest in natural gas as an electricity
source, however, because of its price volatility. We also need to be careful that the gas
is obtained in a safe and environmentally protective manner. This is why i agreed to
serve on the Board of the Center for Sustainable Shale Development (CSSD), a
collaboration built on constructive engagement among environmental organizations,
philanthropic foundations, and energy companies in the Appalachian Basin working to
develop rigorous performance standards for sustainable shale development.

The larger issue, however, involves the absence of any national energy policy that sets a
long-term agenda to reach a low-carbon economy to meet the challenges of a changing
climate. We, as a nation, would be far better off with such an energy policy, instead of
the ad hoc approach we now take.

Page 100

4. Activist Naomi Klein wrote that "with the fossil fuel industry, wrecking the planet is their
business model. It’s what they Do."

Do you agree with this statement?

No

5. On November 3, 2013, climate scientists Kerry Emanuel, Tom Wigley, James Hansen, and Ken
Caldeira, in an open letter to environmentalists, disputed the notion that world energy demand
could be met with 100 percent renewables, Nuclear, they contend, must be part of the
equation: ”Renewables like wind and solar and biomass will certainly play roles in a future
energy economy, but those energy sources cannot scale up fast enough to deliver cheap and
reliable power at the scale the global economy requires. While it may be theoretically possible
to stabilize the climate without nuclear power, in the real world there is no credible path to
climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power."

Do you agree with the authors of this statement?

Yes

6. According to Ted Nordhaus and Michael Schellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute,
"Whatever their merits as innovation policy, Germany’s enormous solar investments have had
little discernible impact on carbon emissions. Germany's move away from baseload zero-carbon
nuclear has resulted in higher coal consumption since 2009. In 2012, Germany's carbon emissions rose 2 percent."

Do you agree with this statement? Do you believe the U.S. should deploy more nuclear
instead of relying on renewables to provide baseload power?

I agree with the statement from the Breakthrough Institute. 1 do not believe, however,
that nuclear and renewables are an either/or proposition. | support increasing our use
of nuclear power while also expanding our use of renewables. Most renewables, like
wind and solar, are not baseload power, however, and require backup power.

7. According to an analysis by the Economist magazine, renewable energy targets in Germany are
popular, but their economic consequences are not. As the Economist explained, consumers
"increasingly dislike” the ”side-effects” of subsidizing renewable energy. ”first, there is the
rising cost of electricity. This is a consequence of a renewable—energy law passed in 2000 which
guarantees not only 20 years of fixed high prices for solar and wind producers but also preferred
access to the electricity grid. As a result, Bavarian roofs now gleam with solar panels and
windmills dominate entire landscapes. Last year, the share of renewables in electricity
production hit a record 23.4%."


Page 101

The Economist explained further, “This subsidy is costly. The difference between the market
price for electricity and the higher fixed price for renewables is passed on to consumers, whose
bills have been rising for years. An average household now pays an extra €260 ($355) a year to
subsidize renewables: the total cost of renewable subsidies in 2013 was €16 billion. Costs are
also going up for companies, making them less competitive than rivals from America, where
energy prices are falling thanks to the fracking boom.”

Do you believe that Germany’s renewable energy policies have delivered zero-carbon
energy without harming consumers? Do you believe that states, as they attempt to
meet EPA’s emissions targets under the proposed Clean Power Plan for existing power
plants, can both deploy more renewable energy while doing so without raising the cost
of electricity, or imposing higher costs on consumers?

I agree that renewable energy can be costly. I will defer to the states on how they will
comply with the Clean Power Plan, but in general I believe we need an “all of the above"
strategy to meet our energy needs while also working to reduce emissions.

8. Do you think the U.S. drilling boom, spurred by the technological advance of hydraulic
fracturing, coupled with horizontal drilling, has been positive or negative for the U.S. economy,
particularly for consumers?

I believe it has been a net positive since it is a domestically-sourced fuel and it has allowed for us
to reduce our coal use. On the other hand, natural gas is subject to price spikes so I believe we
need to be careful not to over-invest in natural gas plants as an electricity source. Also, we
must be sure that the natural gas is extracted safely, in an environmentally protective way. That
is one of the reasons I’ve agreed to serve on the Board of the Center for Sustainable Shale
Development, (CSSD), a collaboration built on constructive engagement among environmental
organizations, philanthropic foundations, and energy companies in the Appalachian Basin
working to develop rigorous performance standards for sustainable shale development.

9. Do you think EPA’s Clean Power Plan will have a meaningful effect on reducing global
greenhouse gas concentrations by 2030? Please explain how the Clean Power Plan will prevent
rising sea levels, droughts, wildfires, and severe weather.

I will defer to the EPA to defend their plan and to explain its results. I do believe, however, that
it is important for our country to take meaningful action on climate change and to show
leadership on the issue if we are going to get the rest of the world to take action also.

10. As you are at least tangentially aware, fossil resources provide the base molecules and products
that we need to manufacture virtually everything we use in a modern society. In fact, coal
combustion byproducts are what comprise, strengthen and make possible our roads and
infrastructure. Chemicals derived from oil and natural gas production are what are refined and


Page 102

manufactured into virtually every product we use today, from computers to our homes, and are
what make possible wind turbines (all components derived, manufactured or refined from fossil
fuels). Accordingly, many claims about eliminating our use of fossil resources are wholly illusory.
However, in order to provide a better understanding of some of your claims regarding our
nation’s dependence on these resources, other than counting intermittent electricity
generations as a product, please provide a comprehensive list of all the things that are a product
or can be manufactured out of sunlight and wind (again please exclude electricity).

I am not sure what you mean by my claims regarding our nation’s dependence on these
resources.” i agree with you that we cannot eliminate the fossil fuel industry. I am not aware of
products manufactured out of sunlight or wind other than electricity, although sunlight is obviously integral to industries involved in food production, lumber, etc.

11. The new NAAQS standard for Pit/12.5 was established in December 2012. Why would EPA
purposely ignore the impact of the new standards on continuing reductions?

I would defer to EPA for a response to this question. This standard was established nearly 10
years after my departure from the agency.

12. Based on EPA’s airtrends data, PMZLS concentrations have been reduced by 33% from Year
2000 to Year 2012, and the trend is for further reductions under the new regulations. Given
this, how and why are “co-benefits” of the GHG NSPS justified?

Again, I would defer to EPA for information pertaining to the GHG NSPS.

13. There are serious problems with the science underpinning the PM2.5 standards. The key
participants (Beale, Brenner, Wegman) were employed during your tenure at EPA,

a) Were you ever briefed by any of these individuals?

b) Did you ever review the work of these individuals?

c) Were you ever made aware of the problems with the data?

d) What regulations were developed or promulgated during your tenure that were
justified based on this data?

a. Yes

b. No. None of these individuals reported to me so I did not review their work.
c. No

d. None that I am aware of,

14. Do you believe it is appropriate for the American public to trust EPA on any regulation that relies upon “secret science”?

Page 103

i believe EPA should use the best science available when developing regulations.

15. Please explain what constitutes a violation of the information Quality Act.

i will defer to the legal experts as to what constitutes a violation of this law. OMB guidance on
the Act can be found here:
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_agency_info_quality_links

16. Please explain what constitutes a violation of the Data Access Act.

i will defer to the legal experts as to what constitutes a violation of the Data Access Act. The
OMB Circular on this issue can be found here: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-10-08/html/99-26264.htm


17. On December 4, 2001, you were advised by Dr. John Graham, OIRA:

Based on our reviews of EPA’s recent rulemakings on air pollution and the agency’s 2001 Regulatory
Plan, it is clear that we need to understand better which sources of PM in our economy are
responsible for the PM-related health effects. As the present time, there is no scientific consensus
about what toxicity values are appropriate for specific types of particles and, as a result, EPA has
adopted a default position in past regulatory analyses that all particles are equally toxic. However,
there is emerging evidence that some types affine particles may pose a greater health risk. The
more recent multi—city studies suggest that PM appears to be more harmful in some cities than
others, variation that may be attributable to the different kinds of particles found in different cities.
Studies vary in their findings about which sources of PM are most strongly related to mortality,
identifying a variety of sources from coal combustion and oil burning to the emissions from motor
vehicles.

If research can identify those particles most responsible for health risks, it may be possible to
design controls that do more for public health and cost the economy less than would occur
through policies that assume all particles are equally toxic. Given the tens of billions of dollars of
social costs that will be devoted to PM emissions over the next 20 years, this follow—up research
should begin without delay in FY 2002.

On March 12, 2002, you responded by indicating that EPA was proceeding with more research.
What were the results of that research while you were at EPA?

I am not aware of any outcomes from the research conducted that year. i left EPA in June 2003.

18. In April 2006 OlRA sent a letter to Admin Johnston (sic) indicating that there were still serious
concerns about the ability of EPA to properly differentiate between the effects of PM2.S and


Page 104

PMlO. Are you aware of any progress in addressing the OIRA concerns about the data and
modeling used by EPA?

No

The ozone concentrations have been reduced 14% from 1990 to 2012 and 9% from 2000 to
2012. The national average is now below the EPA standard. How can EPA justify "co-benefits"
of the GHG NSPS rule? And why has EPA not provided a baseline projection of the ozone levels?

i will defer to EPA to answer questions related to their proposed rule.

EPA is well aware that indoor air is a major factor in asthma incidents. How do you account for
this effect in your views on the NSPS?

I will defer to EPA to answer questions about their proposal. As you know, the rule is a proposal
at this point and is likely to change following the comment period.

21. The Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) was
adopted by EPA to estimate the impacts of C02 reduction policies. Was this model was in use
during your tenure? If the model showed negligible temperature and sea level rise as a result of
a proposal, how should EPA respond? Why didn’t EPA present this analysis in the RIA for the
GHG NSPS?

I do not know whether that model was used in my tenure. I will defer to EPA to answer
questions related to the appropriate use of this model and their GHG NSPS proposal.

22. EPA has used an approach to estimate the impact of loss of discretionary income on premature
death among the elderly. Was this analysis ever used during your tenure at EPA? Why weren’t

these results reported in the GHG RlA?

I do not know if this approach was used during my tenure. Again, I would defer to EPA as to why
these results were not reported in their GHG RlA.

23. Please explain the process of photosynthesis.
See 4th grade science activities in Louisiana for a definition:

http://www.vrml.k12.la.us/4th/science/science bv unitOS/4th 5c unit4/un4act2 sc.htm

24. How many parts per million (ppm) do humans inhale of CO2 when they breathe? How many
ppm do humans exhale when they breathe?

Page 105

For gases by percentage, see http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing

25. Of all the ”pollutants” regulated by the Clean Air Act and EPA, please provide a list of all those
humans exhale at a greater rate than they inhale and at what rate in ppm are they exhaled?

I am not aware of any pollutants that are exhaled at a greater rate than they are inhaled, as is
carbon dioxide,

26. Albert Einstein once famously stated that "the right to search for truth implies also a duty; one
must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be true." Do you agree with this
statement?

Yes, in general.

27. In light of the Einstein quote, please answer the following questions based on
empirical evidence as well as provide the source for your answer:

i. What are all the natural influences on our climate and which ones are
we able to control or not control?

While the Third National Climate Assessment (NCA) can be referenced
to address the entirety of the questions, some natural influences on our
climate include varying solar output from the sun, volcanic eruptions,
and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Human factors are those
we can control and include the emissions of heat-trapping gases and
particles as well as clearing of forests and other land-use changes.

Additionally, the third NCA report explains that natural climate drivers
alone do not explain recent observed warming, and that over the last
half century the majority of the warming at the global scale can only be
explained by the effects of human influences, especially the emissions
from burning fossil fuels and from deforestation.

ii. For how long has the climate been changing and does climate change
predate the internal combustion engine?

Natural influences on our climate have been changing our climate long
before the invention of the internal combustion engine. However, the
scientific consensus from the nation’s climate experts states in the third
NCA that human activities have been the main driver of climate change
for the last half century.

iii. Have global average temperatures over the last 15 years been
increasing, decreasing, or stayed virtually the same?

According to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), global average
temperatures have increased 0.167“C over the last 15 years above the
20th century average — from 046°C above the 20th century average in
1999 to 062°C above the 201h century average in 2013. The NCDC also
finds that 12 of the 13 warmest years on record have occurred in the
last 15 years.

iv. Has all climate change throughout earth’s geologic history been
negative?

The ever-changing climate has positive and negative impacts on people
and the environment across regions around the world. The rate at
which the climate is changing, primarily from the emissions of
greenhouse gases and deforestation resulting from human activities, is
expected to result in negative impacts that will outweigh positive
impacts on a global scale, as stated in the latest global assessment by
the leading climate scientists around the world according to the IPCC.

For example, the IPCC's ARS report states with high confidence that
”globally, positive impacts will be outweighed by the magnitude and
severity of negative impacts...”

The IPCC’s ARS report also states with very high confidence that “[r]ising
sea levels and storm surges, heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland
and coastal flooding, drought and water scarcity, and air pollution pose
widespread negative risks for people, health, livelihoods, assets, local
and national economies, and ecosystems..."

v. Over the last 100 years have hurricanes been increasing or decreasing in
number and intensity?

According to the IPCC’s ARS report, limited observation capabilities have
made it difficult to discern a trend in tropical cyclone activity over the
last century. However, the technological advancements (e.g., the
satellite era) have allowed for more comprehensive observations since
the 1970s, and they have revealed a robust increase in the intensity and
frequency of tropical systems in the North Atlantic. The IPCC also states


Page 107

that projections for the last century indicate a warmer world will result
in an increase in tropical cyclone strength and associated rainfall.

vi. How does the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635 compare to the recent
history of hurricanes in the United States over the last 5 years?

The lack of observational capabilities in the 1635 present challenges in
documenting the Great Colonial Hurricane (GCH) of 1635, which
according to NOAA, were mainly limited to the accounts of William
Bradford and John Winthrop, making a comprehensive assessment of
this hurricane extremely difficult.

Technological and scientific advancements have been exponential since
1635, and assessments of tropical cyclones are now rigorous and
comprehensive. When only taking into account tropical cyclones over
the past 5 years that each cost the United States more than $1 billion,
NCDC estimates they caused nearly $80 billion in aggregate costs.

vii. What decade was the worst decade for drought in the United States?

According to Richard Helm, a meteorologist and drought expert with
NCDC, ”In terms of percent area of country affected by drought (as
measured by the Palmer Drought Index), the 1930‘s Dust Bowl decade is
the worst drought on record by spatial area."

According to NCDC, ”[t]he ’dust bowl/ effect was caused by sustained
drought conditions compounded by years of land management
practices that left topsoil susceptible to the forces of the wind,"
meaning human activities played a role in the magnitude of the
drought.

viii. What decade was the worst decade for wildfires in the United States?

According to the third NCA report, “[S]easonal and multiyear droughts
affect wildfire severity. For example, persistent drought conditions in
the Southwest, combined with wildfire suppression and land
management practices, have contributed to wildfires of unprecedented
size since 2000. five western states (Arizona, Colorado, Utah, California,
and New Mexico) have experienced their largest fires on record at least
once since 2000. Much of the increase in fires larger than 500 acres
occurred in the western United States, and the area burned in the

Page 108

Southwest increased more than 300% relative to the area burned during
the 19705 and early 19805!”

The third NCA report also states, "drought and fire risk are increasing
in many regions as temperatures and evaporation rates rise. The greater
the future warming, the more these risks will increase, potentially
affecting the entire United States.”

ix. is the statement "What we do know is the temperature around the
globe is increasing faster than was predicted even ten years ago” an
accurate statement of global warming claims? Please provide the base
source and by what you are measuring for any supporting position.

According to NCDC, global average temperatures over the last 10 years
have continued to rise. While the increase temperatures has been at a
rate more in-line with the lower end of some model projections,
additional warming to global temperatures will only further enhance the
risk we face from the impacts of climate change in the United States and
globally.

x. What is the current rate of sea level rise, and how does it compare to
the first and second halves of the twentieth century? What has been
the average rate of seal level rise since the last ice age?

According to the lPCC ARS report, it is likely that global mean sea level
has accelerated since 1900. For a comprehensive and detailed answer
to your question, please reference the report.

xi. Please provide a list of the worst ten floods in world history based on
human impacts, including the country and date they occurred, and the
number of human lives lost.

National and international organizations like the National Climatic Data
Center and the World Meteorological Organization can likely provide
you with the answer to your question.

As an overall comment to your questions above, i would say that climate change is a naturally
occurring phenomenon that is exacerbated by human behavior, causing the climate to change at
a rate faster than the environment can adapt. While we cannot determine if a particular
weather event is caused by climate change, we can expect an increased frequency of extreme
weather events.

Questions from:

Senator Jeff Sessions

1.

Administrator Whitman: your testimony acknowledges ”honest disagreement” about
“whether EPA may be stretching its legal authority a bit too far,” What did you mean by
that? Would you agree that there are aspects of EPA’s proposed greenhouse gas
regulations impacting power plants that may not comply with the requirements of law?

Some stakeholders are questioning EPA’s ability to regulate ”beyond the fence.” I trust that
the courts will determine whether EPA has this authority.

2. Even the mere threat of expensive new EPA regulations can hinder job creation and
economic growth. President Obama conceded this fact when, in 2011, he directed EPA to
not move forward with reconsideration of the ozone standard "particularly as our economy
continues to recover” (Pres. Obama, 9/2/2011). Isn’t it true that onerous climate
regulations can increase energy costs on American families?

Climate regulations may lead to increased energy costs but the costs of not acting are
significant as well.

3. The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled in the case of Utility Air Regulatory Group v.
Environmental Protection Agency. Do you agree with the Court‘s decision?

While I have read press reports of the decision, I have not reviewed the court’s ruling in
depth. It was a fractured and complicated decision, but I was encouraged that the Court
largely upheld the ability of the EPA to regulate greenhouse emissions.
