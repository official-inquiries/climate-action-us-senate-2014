ABOUT THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY

The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is an organization of 40,000 lawyers,
law students, scholars and other individuals located in every state and law school in the nation
who are interested in the current state of the legal order. The Federalist Society takes no
position on particular legal or public policy questions, but is founded on the principles that
the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to
our constitution and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what
the law is, not what it should be.

The Federalist Society takes seriously its responsibility as a non—partisan institution engaged
in fostering a serious dialogue about legal issues in the public square. We occasionally produce
“white papers” on timely and contentious issues in the legal or public policy world, in an effort
to widen understanding of the facts and principles involved and to continue that dialogue.

Positions taken on specific issues in publications, however, are those of the author. and not
reflective of an organization stance. This paper presents a number of important issues, and
is part of an ongoing conversation. We invite readers to share their responses, thoughts, and
criticisms by writing to us at info@fedesoc.org, and, if requested, we will consider posting
or airing those perspectives as well. To that end, we offer links below presenting different
perspectives on this issue.

Executive Summary

For roughly two decades, the U.S. Congress has 
possessed a bipartisan consensus on the regulation of 
greenhouse gases from industrial sources: It is best to 
let sleeping dogs lie.[1] Both Democrats and Republicans 
cited a variety of practical problems that would prevent 
the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA” or the 
“Agency”) from using the Clean Air Act (“CAA”)—the 
awkward basis for current greenhouse gas regulation—
to regulate emissions from existing “stationary sources” 
of energy.[2] Nevertheless, President Obama maintains 
that “America cannot resist this transition,”[3] and the 
EPA is thus expected to take a step that many believe 
has not merely prudential, but also legal, problems: 
to reinterpret Section 111(d), a provision of the 
CAA previously limited to existing-source emissions 
of discrete and relatively rare substances, to reach 
ubiquitous greenhouse gases.[4] 

Since the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in 
Massachusetts v. EPA, the EPA has begun regulating 
greenhouse gases under various provisions in the Act, 
including by prescribing fuel-efficiency standards for 
motor vehicles and by requiring control technology 
for greenhouse gas emissions in some preconstruction 
permits. Outside environmental groups took advantage 
of the new uncertainty in how far the EPA could go 
in regulating greenhouse gases by suing the Agency in 
2008. The EPA settled the case in 2010, promising 
regulation different from past actions: mandating 
emission reductions from existing stationary sources of 
greenhouse gases,[5] the very subject that has bedeviled 
Congress for years. Without any new authority from 
Congress, the EPA is undertaking this new regulatory 
mission. The EPA, for its part, denies that its 
interpretation is a stretch, asserting in a 2008 Advance 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPR”) that cap-
and-trade is a permissible form of 111(d) regulation.[6] 
However, there are very strong arguments that the EPA’s 
current interpretation of Section 111(d) is at odds with 
the controlling statutory language and dilutes that 
language to fit the Agency’s regulatory aims.[7] 

The EPA’s approach here, on this view, amounts 
not simply to circumventing the democratic process, 
but a depreciation of the practical problems this new 
regulation will pose—problems that the democratic 
process could address. In the 2008 ANPR, the 
Department of Energy (among others) noted the 
“burdensome and intrusive regulatory mechanism 
unlike any seen before” in the EPA’s likely course.[8] The 
potential breadth of the EPA’s efforts may require it to 
re-construe Section 111(d) to avoid issuing permits and 
ensuring compliance for all sizes of “stationary sources,” 
which it has already had to do in its Prevention of 
Significant Deterioration (PSD) permit program.[9] 

1. Since the Clean Air Act’s 1990 amendments, the U.S. Congress 
abandoned a variety of attempts to address greenhouse gas 
(“GHG”) emissions through new legislation. They include, but 
are by no means limited to, the American Clean Energy and 
Security Act of 2009, America’s Climate Security Act of 2007, 
and the 2003 and 2005 Climate Stewardship Acts.

the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions could result in a 
“glorious mess.” See Chris Holly, Dingell: EPA Climate Regulation 
Would Lead To ‘Glorious Mess,’ The Energy Daily (IHS), Apr. 11,

(and, in some ways, supplements their measurements) so as to 
hone in on the largest greenhouse gas emitters. See 77 Fed. Reg.

While the Obama Administration has not yet 
proposed standards for existing power plants, such a 
move is expected within the year. With the prospect 
of imminent action, and growing political pressure to 
coerce unwilling states into unprecedented greenhouse 
gas regulation,10 whether the EPA has the authority to 
take these actions must be explored.

This paper concludes that it does not: In amending 
Section 111(d) in the Clean Air Act Amendments 
of 1990, Congress unambiguously provided that the 
subsection could not be used to set standards for 
industries that are also regulated under the Clean Air 
Act’s Section 112 air toxics program. Because existing 
power plants have been regulated under that program 
since the 2012 Utility maximum achievable control 
technology (“MACT”) Rule,11 the EPA may not 
lawfully regulate them under Section 111(d).

 The EPA has disputed this limitation since 2005, 
when it sought to use cap-and-trade to regulate mercury 
emissions.12 Some legal commentators have argued that 
cap-and-trade is within the province of EPA’s regulatory 
authority.13 But they do not address whether Congress 
actually delegated to the EPA authority to construe 
Section 111(d) to regulate greenhouse gas emissions 
of existing stationary sources. While the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the EPA’s 
reformulation of power plant regulation on procedural 
grounds, it did not address the problems posed by the 
EPA’s interpretation of Section 111(d).14

This paper will explore the EPA’s anticipated 
efforts to interpret its own authority to reach the goal 
of regulating of greenhouse gas emissions from existing 
stationary sources. This initiative raises serious questions 
of statutory interpretation, practical implementation, 
and the legitimacy of an administrative agency taking 
action without delegated authority from Congress. At 
the outset, a brief history of the EPA’s efforts to regulate 
greenhouse gas, and an outline of what cap-and-trade 
regulation would look like under Section 111(d), are 
required to grasp how the statute works.

I. A Brief History of the Clean Air Act and 
Greenhouse Gas Regulation

A. Greenhouse Gas Regulation Before Massachusetts v. 
EPA

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 197015 
essentially established the modern Clean Air Act. 
The 1970 Amendments built on 1950s and 1960s 
legislation addressing air pollution, but expanded the 
——————————
41,051 (July 12, 2012). Nevertheless, expanding the targetable 
sources of greenhouse gas emitters raises similar questions of 
how far the EPA could credibly tailor its permitting and still see 
meaningful greenhouse gas reduction—especially if such tailoring 
is informed by prioritizing administration and compliance costs 
over greenhouse gas reduction. Cf. supra note 8.

10 See, e.g., Daniel A. Lashof, Starla Yeh, David Doniger, Sheryl 
Carter & Laurie Johnson, Closing the Power Plant Carbon 
Pollution Loophole: Smart Ways the Clean Air Act Can Clean Up 
America’s Biggest Climate Polluters, Natural Res. Def. Council

From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating 
Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired 
Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small 
Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units, 77 
Fed. Reg. 9,304 (Feb. 16, 2012).

12 On March 15, 2005, the EPA issued the “Clean Air Mercury 
Rule” that provided for the capping and reduction of mercury 
emissions from coal-powered plants. As mercury was listed as 
a “hazardous air pollutant” (“HAP”) under Section 112 of the 
Act, the EPA needed to delist mercury from Section 112 to 
reach it under Section 111(d), as discussed infra. See also Final 
Brief of Respondent Envtl. Prot. Agency, New Jersey v. EPA, 
517 F.3d 574, 583 (D.C. Cir. 2008), 2007 WL 3231264, at 
*101-02 (explaining that the 1990 CAA amendments provide 
language prohibiting a Section 112 HAP from being regulated 
under Section 111(d) as an existing source). This delisting, 
vacated on procedural grounds, 517 F.3d at 583, allowed the 
EPA to fashion a construction of 111(d)’s language that would 
permit cap-and-trade regulation of existing stationary sources—a 
position the EPA still maintains. See supra note 6; see also 73 
Fed. Reg. at 44,495 n.253 (noting that “many sources may be 
subject to standards under both section 111 and 112; however 
these standards establish requirements for the control of different 
pollutants.”). This is the EPA’s current interpretation, though 
as discussed infra it must be an incorrect construction because 
it dilutes the effect of the U.S. Senate’s amended language and 
renders the House’s language a nullity.

Act for Cap-and-Trade of Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Obstacles and 
Solutions, 30 UCLA J. Envtl. L. & Pol’y 1, 34-45 (2012).

scope of federal authority in this area to such an extent 
that they are recognized as the true beginning of the 
modern regime.

The starting point for understanding the Clean Air 
Act is the principle of cooperative federalism.16 The 
Act “establishes a partnership between EPA and the 
states for the attainment and maintenance of national 
air quality goals.”17 “[A]ir pollution prevention . . . 
and air pollution control at its source is the primary 
responsibility of States and local governments[.]”18 
Stationary sources—for example, power plants—
are therefore primarily regulated through state-
specific implementation of general federal guidelines, 
formulated and implemented by the states, with the 
EPA playing an oversight role after its promulgation of 
initial guidelines. By contrast, mobile sources—“planes, 
trains, and automobiles”—are subject to more direct 
federal regulation, for example in the form of fuel 
quality standards.

The Clean Air Act accordingly divides national 
policy into two primary titles: Title I for control of 
stationary sources of pollution,19 and Title II for control 
of mobile sources of pollution.20 The fundamental 
control program in Title I of the Act is the national 
ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) program, 
which sets air quality standards at the level “requisite to 
protect the public health.”21 Because every stationary 
source of air pollution is local, and decisions about what 
sources are economically and environmentally desirable 
implicate state and local concerns, the NAAQS are 
primarily implemented through state implementation 
plans. In this regard, Congress “carefully balanced 
State and national interests by providing for a fair and 
open process in which State and local governments 
and the people they represent will be free to carry out 
the reasoned weighing of environmental and economic 
goals and needs.”22

Title I of the Act also includes several other 
major regulatory programs for stationary sources. 
For the control of hazardous air pollutants (“HAPs”), 
Section 112 of the Act provides for the establishment 
of National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air 
Pollutants (“NESHAPs”).23 Section 112 mandates that 
the EPA regulate most, but not all, emitters of 189 listed 
hazardous air pollutants.24

Additionally, Title I provides for New Source 
Performance Standards (NSPS) in Section 111. These 
NSPS regulate emissions from newly constructed 
or substantially modified stationary sources without 
reference to existing local air quality.25 Although the 
bulk of Section 111 concerns emissions standards for 
new sources, subsection 111(d) provides the EPA with 
authority to set standards for certain categories of 
existing sources. This authority is subject, however, to 
significant limitations, the details of which are addressed 
in the bulk of this paper.

B. Massachusetts v. EPA Introduces Greenhouse Gas 
Regulation to the CAA 

For the first three and a half decades of the 
Act’s existence, it was used to control the emission 
of substances that directly injure public health and 
welfare—e.g., those that aggravate asthma, damage 
crops, or reduce visibility. In 2006, the EPA issued a

final rule setting performance standards for the emission 
of certain substances from existing power plants.26 
Greenhouse gases were not among them.27 A coalition 
of petitioners—comprised of three environmental 
groups (the Natural Resources Defense Council, the 
Sierra Club, and the Environmental Defense Fund), 
eleven states (NY, CA, CT, DE, MA, ME, NM, OR, 
RI, VT, WA), the District of Columbia, and the City 
of New York—challenged the EPA’s rulemaking on 
several grounds in the United States Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia Circuit.28 One of their 
complaints was the argument that the Clean Air Act 
obligated the EPA to set standards for greenhouse gas 
emissions.

In September 2006, the portions of the challenge 
relating to greenhouse gas emissions were severed from 
the other challenges and held in abeyance pending the 
Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA.29 
The Court held in 2007 that greenhouse gases fit 
within the Act’s expansive definition of “air pollutant.”30 
Although the opinion directly concerns the emission of 
greenhouse gases from motor vehicles under Title II, 
since 2007 Massachusetts has “spurred a cascading series 
of greenhouse gas-related rules and regulations,”31 most 
notably in the Act’s preconstruction permitting program 
for major stationary sources, such as many power plants 
and factories. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, 
the D.C. Circuit remanded the power plant challenge 
to the EPA for further proceedings.

Rather than set its own regulatory agenda, the 
EPA chose to settle. In December 2010, the EPA 
entered into a settlement agreement that required it 
to set standards for greenhouse gas emissions under 
111(b) for new and modified power plants and 111(d) 
for existing power plants by July 26, 2011. It further 
undertook to establish final rules following public 
comment, first for new and then for existing plants, 
by May 26, 2012.32 The settlement agreement itself 
announces that the EPA has initially determined “that 
there are cost-effective control strategies for reducing” 
greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and that 
“it would be appropriate for it to concurrently propose 
performance standards for [greenhouse gas] emissions 
from new and modified [plants] under [Clean Air 
Act] section 111(b) . . . and . . . from existing [plants] 
pursuant to [Clean Air Act] section 111(d)[.]” Unlike 
other regulatory actions, this settlement agreement was 
not subject to public notice or comment, and there is 
therefore no record showing that the Agency’s leadership 
seriously analyzed its legal authority to carry out the 
settlement. In these respects and others, the settlement 
appears to be a typical example of “sue and settle” 
regulation, under which the EPA settles actions—often 
under a consent decree but sometimes, as in this case, 
by voluntary settlement without judicial approval—in a 
way that binds it to significant regulatory commitments 
without appropriate input from Congress, other federal 
agencies, and other stakeholders.33 Resources for the

was “hard to describe as anything other than a victory

C. The Use of “Performance Standards” to Regulate 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions

The EPA’s prior attempt to regulate mercury 
emissions through cap-and-trade highlights how 
Section 111(d) would theoretically handle a cap-and-
trade scheme.35 Yet Section 111(d)’s characteristics 
also reveal the scheme’s fatal flaws in the context of 
greenhouse gases and existing stationary sources.

Section 111(d) does not provide for cap-and-
trade explicitly, but the EPA would likely consider it 
a “system of emission reduction,” an open-ended term 
within Section 111.36 Under Section 111(d), a state 
would theoretically implement cap-and-trade as part 
of its “standards of performance for any existing source 
for any air pollutant” that other CAA sections do not 
classify as criteria pollutants or HAPs.37

The Clean Air Act is an awkward tool with which 
to regulate greenhouse gases. The greenhouse gas of 
primary concern is carbon dioxide, which is not an 
exotic compound produced in a few industrial processes, 
but is inevitably produced by the combustion of coal, 
gas or any other fossil fuel. The EPA has (correctly) 
refrained from suggesting that greenhouse gases38 are 
criteria pollutants subject to the NAAQS regime, or 
classifying them as hazardous air pollutants subject 
to the NESHAP regime. In light of the December 
2010 settlement, it seems unlikely that the EPA will 
attempt to fit the square peg of greenhouse gases into 
the Act’s round holes through any other means than 
“performance standards” under Section 111.39 
of the Act. Part II of this paper explains why this 
assertion is incorrect.

II. Section 111(d) Does Not Authorize 
Performance Standards for Existing Power 
Plants

While the EPA asserted in a 2008 Advance 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that cap-and-trade is 
a permissible form of 111(d) regulation,41 it will likely 
rely on its December 2010 settlement as the impetus 
for any new rules in this regard. Reliance upon the 
settlement, from the EPA’s perspective, affords it the 
path of least resistance—the EPA will argue that it is

and (as is often the case) activist groups’ attorneys, it is the

at the table as the agency reorganizes its agenda by committing 
to take particular regulatory actions at particular times”). For 
“sue and settle” tactics generally, see “EPA’s New Regulatory 
Front: Regional Haze and the Takeover of State Programs,” U.S.

39 See Richardson, supra note 34, at 9 (footnote omitted):

The agency is unlikely to pursue existing-source GHG 
regulation under other CAA programs. Issuing a GHG 
NAAQS is no longer a plausible option, if it ever was. A 
NAAQS would supersede GHG ESPS. The agency would 
not spend scarce administrative resources devising an ESPS 
regulatory program only to junk it in favor of something 
else. § 115 regulation is similarly unlikely, though it is not 
mutually exclusive with ESPS. The settlement agreement 
also reflects a consensus among the agency, many states, and 
key environmental groups on using the § 111performance 
standards pathway for GHGs.

legally bound to carry out its settlement bargain, lest a 
court order force it to do so, and is thus immune from 
“political” concerns over cap-and-trade. Yet this would 
leave important statutory and separation of powers 
questions unaddressed.

The EPA’s 2010 settlement committed the Agency 
to rulemaking on a matter that the Congress has 
repeatedly (and explicitly) failed to address: regulating 
greenhouse gas emissions from existing stationary energy 
sources. The EPA cannot bargain with authority it never 
possessed. It cannot commit itself to doing something 
it has no power to do. In short, the EPA will use the 
color of one branch’s authority (the judiciary) to sidestep 
lacking authority from another branch (the legislature) 
in an effort to inflate the power of its own branch (the 
executive). As this transgression of separated powers is 
rather obvious, the EPA will claim instead that Section 
111(d) already allows the Agency to craft performance 
standards for existing stationary sources.

But a close analysis of the text of Section 111(d) 
suggests the EPA misreads its authority. In the 1990 
Amendments, Congress expressly barred the EPA from 
setting Section 111(d) standards for source categories—
like power plants—that are regulated under the Act’s 
Section 112 air toxics program.

A. The History of Section 111(d)

The history of Section 111(d) is critical to 
understanding how and why Congress barred the EPA 
from duplicative regulation of sources under Sections 
111(d) and 112. As originally enacted in 1970, 
subsection (d)(1) read as follows:

The Administrator shall prescribe regulations 
which shall establish a procedure similar to that 
provided by section 11042 under which each 
State shall submit to the Administrator a plan 
which (A) establishes emission standards for any 
existing source for any air pollutant (i) for which 
air quality criteria have not been issued or which is not included on a list published under section 108(a) 
or 112(b)(1)(A) but (ii) to which a standard of 
performance under subsection (b) would apply if 
such existing source were a new source, and (B) 
provides for the implementation and enforcement 
of such emission standards.43

Accordingly, under the version of this subsection 
enacted in 1970, the EPA is precluded from using 
the 111(d) program to set standards for pollutants 
already regulated under either section 108 (the “criteria 
pollutants” of the NAAQS regime) or section 112 (the 
list of “hazardous air pollutants” or HAPs).

 In 1990, Congress amended Section 111(d) as 
part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. As 
presented in the current version of the United States 
Code, 42 U.S.C. § 7411(d)(1) provides that:

The Administrator shall prescribe regulations 
which shall establish a procedure similar to that 
provided by section 7410 of this title under which 
each State shall submit to the Administrator a plan 
which (A) establishes standards of performance44 
for any existing source for any air pollutant (i) for 
which air criteria have not been issued or which 
is not included on a list published under section 
7408(a) of this title or emitted from a source 
category which is regulated under section 7412 of 
this title[.]

(Emphases added.) The substitution of “or 112(b)(1)(A)” 
with “or emitted from a source category which is 
regulated under section 7412 of this title” originated 
in the House of Representatives’ version of the 
Amendments. Importantly, it alters the focus of the 
limitations on the EPA’s authority to regulate existing 
sources of air pollutants under Section 111. From its 
creation in 1970 until its amendment in 1990, this 
portion of the Act spoke only in terms of pollutants 
whose emission from existing sources fell outside the 
scope of Section 111(d)—i.e., those pollutants already 
subject to regulation under Sections 108 and 112 (the 
NAAQS and NESHAP regimes). The current text of 
———————————
42 As codified at 42 U.S.C. § 7410, this section provides a two-
stage process: (1) The EPA promulgates national standards; (2) 
states then submit implementation plans for EPA approval. This 
assignment of primary responsibility for implementation to the 
states is in keeping with Congress’s finding that “air pollution 
control at its source is the primary responsibility of States and 
local governments.” 42 U.S.C. § 7401(a)(3).

standards” (the 1970 language) with “standards of performance.”

(Emphases added.) This reading, which fully enacts both 
amendments, is the correct and valid law. Although it 
is not reflected in the current text of the United States 
Code, the Code is only prima facie evidence of the law. 
Where the Code and the Statutes at Large conflict, the 
latter must prevail.51 Here, the text of the Statutes at 
Large contains both amendments.52 Moreover, this text 
of the amendments is the only one that is consistent 
with Congress’s intent in enacting both provisions.53

This reading evinces that the two amendments to 
Section 111(d) place different limitations on the scope 
of EPA’s authority; these limitations are motivated by 
different purposes, address different aspects of EPA’s 
regulatory authority elsewhere in the Act, and are 
entirely capable of co-existing. As such, statutory 
construction compels they be read compatibly.54

In enacting the House amendment, Congress 
added a limitation on the reach of 111(d): where a 
category of sources is being regulated under Section 112, 
Section 111(d) cannot be used to impose additional 
performance standards on that source category. The 
purpose of the House amendment is clear. In the 
1990 Amendments, Congress changed the broader 
way that Section 112 operated, switching from a 
risk-based model to a technology-based one.55 Under 
the new approach, pollutant standards under Section 
112 must reflect the “maximum achievable control 
technology,” or MACT. Aware that this change would 
significantly increase compliance burdens, the House 
intended with its amendment to ensure that existing 
source categories regulated under Section 112 would 
not face the prospect of additional costly regulation 
under Section 111.56

Congress’ objective in precluding source category 
regulation is all the more obvious in light of the recent 
promulgation of new source performance standards for 
greenhouse gases. The EPA’s recently-enacted Utility 
MACT Rule imposes $11 billion in annual compliance 
costs, the vast majority of which are born by existing 
power plants.57 Preventing the EPA from “double-
dipping” and imposing billions more in compliance 
costs on this source category through Section 111(d) is 
a feature of the 1990 Amendments, not a bug.

In contrast, in enacting the Senate amendment, 
Congress intended to maintain the pre-1990 prohibition 
on using Section 111(d) to regulate emissions from 
existing sources of those substances regulated as 
hazardous pollutants under Section 112. Failing to 
retain the existing limit on EPA authority to regulate 
hazardous air pollutants under Section 112 would 
allow the Agency to undo Congress’ considered 
decision to regulate only certain sources of hazardous 
air pollutants—the 1990 Amendments require the EPA 
to regulate all major sources of hazardous air pollutants, 
but only 90 percent of emissions of area sources.58

Thus, in accordance with this reading of Section 
111(d), the EPA lacks authority to establish standards of 
performance for existing sources of air pollutants which

deregulatory emphasis and were designed to ease the burden on 
regulated industries, note that the House amendment to 111(d)

Senate’s draft amendment to Section 112 with regard to power 
plant regulation. See 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,030 (EPA discussion of

are included on a list published under Sections 108(a) 
or 112(b) (a substance-focused limitation on authority) 
or which are emitted from source categories regulated 
under Section 112 (a source-focused limitation). 
Since power plants are regulated under Section 112,59 
therefore, Section 111(d) does not provide the EPA 
with authority to establish standards of performance 
for greenhouse emissions therefrom.

C. Even If Congress’s Intent Is Unclear, the Statute as 
Amended Can Be Read To Give Full Effect to Both 
Amendments to Section 111(d)

Congress acted with intelligible and distinct 
intent in 1990 in enacting both the Senate and House 
amendments to Section 111(d). Yet even if the intent 
is unclear, courts are compelled by accepted rules of 
statutory construction to “harmonize” textual provisions 
“and give meaningful effect to all of the provisions” 
therein.60 Here, again, the EPA’s interpretation fails in 
properly applying the harmonization canon.

The EPA will use its 2005 “harmonization” of 
Section 111(d)’s House and Senate amendments 
to combine the provisions into an unrecognizable 
regulation. In 2005, the EPA attempted to delist 
power plants from the list of sources of hazardous air 
pollutants subject to regulation under Section 112. 
Simultaneously, it sought to establish a cap-and-trade 
program for power plants’ mercury emissions under 
Section 111(d). The EPA based that program on the 
following interpretation of Section 111(d):

Where a source category is being regulated 
under section 112, a section 111(d) standard of 
performance cannot be established to address 
any HAP listed under section 112(b) that may 
be emitted from that particular source category.61

That construction suited EPA’s purposes in 
the delisting decision: The delisting decision was a 
precursor to the Agency’s Clean Air Mercury Rule 
(referenced supra as a precedent for cap-and-trade under 
Section 111(d)), and because mercury compounds 
are listed under Section 112(b), EPA’s interpretation 
allowed it to establish Section 111(d) standards of 
performance for their emission from power plants after 
the delisting decision. In this way, the EPA did what 
the harmonization canon works to avoid: only giving 
“some effect to both provisions” rather than giving 
“meaningful effect to all of the provisions.”62 The result 
is the creation of an unidentifiable, alternative provision 
from what Congress passed.

The D.C. Circuit vacated the EPA’s mercury 
cap-and-trade program because it held that the EPA’s 
delisting decision proceeded under the incorrect 
statutory authority.63 The court did not, however, rule 
on the EPA’s construction of Section 111(d). Now, to 
carry out its settlement agreement, the EPA will look 
to use this reformulation of Section 111(d) to put 
stationary, existing energy sources like power plants 
regulated under Section 112 in its sights for greenhouse 
gas regulation.

A proper application of the harmonization canon 
is the same as in the plain-meaning interpretation of 
the Clean Air Act: both the Senate and the House 
amendments limit the reach of Section 111(d). As 
explained supra, Congress’ two amendments to Section 
111(d) accomplish separate goals: The amendment 
originating in the House of Representatives is a 
deregulatory provision that precludes industries from 
being hit by the double-punch of Section 112 and 
Section 111(d); the amendment originating in the 
Senate preserves Section 112 as the exclusive mechanism 
for regulating hazardous air pollutants under the Act. 
These provisions do not conflict in any way. Rather, 
they complement each other.

In contrast, the EPA weakens both of Congress’s 
Section 111(d) amendments in its construction from 
the delisting decision. The amendment originating in 
the House, which Congress intended as a deregulatory 
provision for industries that were subject to Section 112 
regulation, is given no effect at all—under the previous 
version of Section 111(d) and the Senate Bill, regulation

of hazardous air pollutants was already precluded for 
all source categories. Also, the amendment originating 
in the Senate, which was intended to maintain Section 
112 as the exclusive program for hazardous air pollutant 
regulation from stationary sources, is given diluted 
effect through a source category limitation imported 
from the House’s amendment.

In other words, the EPA offered a construction that 
neither retains those limitations (as would the Senate 
amendment standing alone), nor alters them (as would 
the House amendment alone), but rather shrinks them. 
This construction is not permissible under either classic 
statutory construction canons or the administrative law 
analysis of delegated agency authority.

Under step one of a Chevron analysis, “[i]f the 
intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; 
for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to 
the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”64 
Thus, as long as the intent of the amendments taken 
individually is clear, and as long as they are capable of 
simultaneous implementation, “that is the end of the 
matter.” As described supra, and as the EPA recognized 
in its delisting decision,65 neither amendment read 
independently evinces intent to weaken the existing 
limitations on 111(d). No permissible attempt to 
harmonize the two can achieve that result.

Finally, even if, under the first step of a Chevron 
analysis, the intent of Congress is not clear, a court 
will not simply accept an agency’s interpretation of its 
governing statute without further inquiry. Instead, 
in the second step of Chevron analysis, a court must 
consider “whether the agency’s [interpretation] is based 
on a permissible construction of the statute.”66 The 
interpretation of the two amendments offered by the 
EPA in 2005 is not permissible, since it weakens the pre-
1990 limitations on Section 111(d) and, in so doing, 
gives meaningful effect to neither amendment.

The EPA’s likely response to this analysis would 
be to emphasize the Agency’s entitlement to deference 
in defining the scope of vague and ambiguous statutes. 

Here, the EPA could follow the arguments of some 
commentators that look at the history of Section 111(d) 
and conclude that the section’s language is meant to 
provide a “gap filler” for incremental cap-and-trade 
implementation within the CAA amendments.67

It is true that “even without express authority to 
fill a specific statutory gap, circumstances pointing to 
implicit congressional delegation” may require courts 
to defer to agencies’ interpretations of their governing 
statutes.68 But here, there is neither express nor implicit 
delegation of “gap-filling” authority. The admittedly 
unusual drafting history here calls not for discretionary 
administrative decision-making, but rather the 
traditional exercise of core judicial functions of statutory 
construction. Failing to exercise de novo review over the 
EPA’s interpretation of the statute would be to claim 
without proof that Congress desired the Agency to 
resolve what it never could through the transparency 
of democracy: whether the federal government should 
enact a cap-and-trade regulatory regime. Yet, as the 
Supreme Court has confirmed, “Congress . . . does not 
alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in 
vague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not, one 
might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.”69 In short, 
two decades of failed Congressional attempts at cap-
and-trade do not make it magically manifest in Section 
111(d).

D. Alternatively, the House Amendment Can Be Read as 
Implicitly Repealing the Senate Amendment

There is a third and final possible reading of the 
statute if the EPA or a court were convinced that 
Congress did not intend to enact both amendments 
to Section 111(d) and that the amendments cannot 
be harmonized: that the amendment originating in 
the House of Representatives implicitly repeals the 
Senate amendment. In that case, the plain meaning 
of Section 111(d), as amended to preclude existing 
source performance standards for industries regulated

Page 265

under the Clean Air Act’s Section 112 air toxics 
program—reflected by the U.S. Code only containing 
the House amendment—would preclude the EPA’s 
anticipated greenhouse gas standards. While this 
interpretation of the statute and its amendments is 
not ideal, in that it would not honor the intent of the 
Senate amendment and would remove an important 
substance-focused limitation on the Agency’s authority 
under the subsection, it is at least a coherent theory of 
what Congress intended—and it results in a workable 
statute. The EPA’s response to this argument would 
likely be that the amendments can be harmonized, but 
its theory of harmonization must fail for the reasons 
discussed above. If the amendments are not both 
honored in full, the House amendment should take 
precedence over the one that originated in the Senate.

The canon of implied repeal applies where there 
is “an irreconcilable conflict between the two federal 
statutes at issue.”70 Although the Supreme Court has 
suggested that it applies only in the case of “earlier and 
later statutes [that] are irreconcilable,”71 there is no case 
law directly stating that this canon is inapplicable to 
irreconcilable earlier and later amendments to a single 
bill.

In this regard, if Congress did not intend 
both amendments to Section 111(d) in the 1990 
Amendments to be enacted, it would have intended 
the House of Representatives’ amendment to control. 
The 1990 Amendments originated in the Senate, 
which passed S.1630 on April 3, 1990.72 This version 
of S.1630 contained the revised text of Section 112, 
which removed the old Section 112(b)(1)(A) and 
replaced it with a new Section 112(b)(1) containing a 
list of hazardous air pollutants, as explained above.73 It 
also contained the conforming amendment to Section 
111(d),74 which—under this interpretation—did 
nothing more than alter the reference to Section 112 
found in Section 111(d) to reflect the new organization 
of Section 112.

The House, in turn, amended and passed S.1630 
on May 23, 1990.75 The version passed by the house 
added the House amendment,76 which removed the 
(now-obsolete) reference to “112(b)(1)(A)” found in 
Section 111(d) and replaced it with the phrase “or 
emitted from a source category which is regulated under 
Section 112.” In so doing, the House amendment 
effected a substantive change in the limitations imposed 
on Section 111(d), where the Senate amendment 
merely altered a reference to conform to changes made 
elsewhere in the Act. But the House neglected to 
strike the Senate’s “conforming amendment,” and the 
bill was reconciled at conference with the now-obsolete 
Senate amendment left intact.77 As between a technical 
and conforming amendment in a prior version of the 
legislation, and a substantive amendment designed 
to alter the scope of Section 111(d), the substantive 
amendment should be the one that is given full force 
and effect if the two amendments are irreconcilable.

 As such, whether the different amendments to 
Section 111(d) in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 
1990 are complementary, harmonized, or conflict, the 
common theme is that the EPA cannot promulgate 
existing source performance standards for source 
categories that are regulated under Section 112, such 
as power plants.

III. Conclusion

While the courts will grant the EPA broad 
deference to determine a permissible reading of Section 
111(d), the Agency cannot adopt an interpretation 
repelled by the statute’s text.78 Here, the controlling 
Statutes-At-Large text of Section 111(d) precludes the 
EPA’s contorted attempt to reformulate the listing of 
stationary energy sources so as to include them in a

cap-and-trade scheme Congress never authorized. The 
EPA thus cannot rely on its December 2010 settlement 
agreement to expand the breadth of its own power, 
and a court cannot be used to enforce authority that 
the Agency never had to bargain in the first instance. 
President Obama may ultimately be right to think 
that “America cannot resist this transition” to a highly 
regulated energy sector in the name of “greener” energy. 
Nevertheless, the Administration will need the authority 
of Congress to set that transition in motion.
