OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF SESSIONS, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA 

Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. 
I know these are important issues to you and you have spent a 
lot of time and effort in mastering these issues. 
I am pleased to have our guests with us, the former EPA Admin-
istrators. We have indeed made a lot of progress in our Country 
since the Environmental Protection Agency was started several 
years ago. We appreciate your leadership in that regard. 
It is great to have Attorney General Luther Strange, my able 
successor as Attorney General of the State of Alabama. Attorney 
Generals have environmental responsibilities for their States.

Dr. Mason, it is great to have you and Dr. Botkin, it is wonderful 
to have you with us. I think it will be a good hearing today. 
We have had some agreement on a number of issues that we 
ought to celebrate. We had agreement at one point, I thought, that 
we would expand nuclear power, which emits no CO2 and other 
pollutants into the atmosphere but we are not making much 
progress there. We have lost four plants in the last few years. A 
fifth is due to close, I believe, in 2019 and only two are under con-
struction. 

How do we get clean energy at a reasonable cost without more 
nuclear power, it seems to me? We have had some agreement on 
ethanol though I wonder now whether my votes or my ideas were 
quite as positive as we thought at the time on ethanol. Good people 
disagree on the wisdom of ethanol. 

We have had some good legislation and maybe some over reach-
ing but some good legislation on efficiency. We can agree on how 
to make our automobiles, our plants and our buildings more energy 
efficient but we are concerned about the dramatic economic costs, 
the costs that would fall on the backs of many of the people sitting 
in our audience today who produce that huge portion of our energy, 
coal, and other energy production that will be adversely impacted 
by the President’s regulations. 

We have to ask some tough questions about that. I think we will. 
It has been mentioned that we have had some storms. I would 
note that hurricane Sandy was not a hurricane. By the time it hit 
shore, it was a tropical storm. We are not seeing increases in hurri-
canes. In fact, it has been 3,100 days since we have had a Category 
3 hurricane in America. That is a remarkable time and maybe one 
of the longest ever. 

IPCC’s fifth climate assessment report released last year said, 
‘‘Current data sets indicate no significant observed trends in global 
tropical cyclone frequency over the past century. Dr. Pilkey testi-
fied here that we don’t have more tornadoes, we don’t have more 
droughts and we don’t have more floods, according to the data he 
has evaluated. 

I just say that it is right and just that members who represent 
the people of the United States, the workers of the United States, 
the people who pay electricity bills and pay their gas bills to go to 
work every day, we represent them too. 

We have to ask ourselves are we doing something to this econ-
omy that is not good for us and how can we make positive gains 
together without damaging our economy. I would note, just for the 
record, that our colleagues need to know that our economy is strug-
gling. We are not doing well. 

Since 2009, median household income has fallen by $2,300. Since 
2009, 7.2 million people have left the work force. Growth in the 
first quarter of this year was negative 1 percent. One out of every 
six men 25 to 54 is not working today. These are statistics that 
ought to cause us concern. 

We have found that many of the regulations are ineffective. The 
United States’ actions which have been improving with CO2 emis-
sions and we are containing the growth of CO2 more than most 
countries in the world, will be insignificant in the total world im-
pact.

I hope that this committee hearing will be positive and we can 
find some common ground and work together but CO2 is not the 
kind of pollutant, Ms. Whitman and gentlemen, that you fought ef-
fectively—NOx, SOx, particulates, and mercury. CO2 is not that 
same kind of pollutant, it just isn’t, and we have to be careful that 
we don’t hammer this economy attempting to achieve something we 
have very little ability to achieve. 
Thank you, Mr.Chairman. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Sessions. 
For our final statement, we have Senator Booker of New Jersey.
