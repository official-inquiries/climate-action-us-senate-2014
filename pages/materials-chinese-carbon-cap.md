CHINA: Nation announces plan to cap carbon emissions

Published: Tuesday. June 3. 2014

China today announced plans to set a nationwide cap on carbon emissions in 2016, a move that
could be a turning point in UN. climate change negotiations starting this week in Germany.

The cap will go into effect when China‘s next five-year economic growth plan starts in 2016, He
Jiankun, chairman of China's Advisory Committee on Climate Change, said at a conference in
Beijing. Details of the plan, including the level of the CO2 cap, likely won't be finalized until
next year.

China's announcement comes on the eve of 10-day U.N. climate talks among 190 nations
scheduled to start tomorrow in Bonn, Germany (ClimateWire, June 2).

The plan also follows the Obama administration’s announcement yesterday of a proposed rule
curbing greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. China and the United States are
the world’s two largest emitters of carbon dioxide.

The proposals could mark a breakthrough in efforts to reach an international climate change
treaty, experts said.

"It sends a very powerful signal to the rest of the world to get serious," said John Connor, CEO
of the Melbourne-based Climate Institute (Chen/Reklev, Reuters, June 3). -- DB

NATIONS: Some indications that China may be preparing to cap its carbon emissions

A leading Chinese scholar’s assertion that China is poised to enact a carbon emissions cap was
met with praise and caution in the United States yesterday.

He Jiankun, a professor at Tsinghua University and deputy director of China‘s National Expert
Committee on Climate Change, set off alarm bells when Reuters reported his comments that
China will make its greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2030.

Coming on the heels of the Obama administration's announcement of a 30 percent cut in power
plant emissions by 2030, He's statement heightened hope for the international climate
negotiations.

But He is not a government official. And in a country not known for its transparency, observers
said deciphering whether the professor spoke with the government‘s blessing or was merely
repeating a position he has long advocated and researched —— publishing a report on the subject in
the journal Energy Policy in 2012 -- is a tricky business.

"What he said shouldn't be considered official. but he is one of the most important advisers on
climate change. His views are very important, and his team is very involved in this research,"
said Ailun Yang, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute think tank.

Speaking at a conference in Beijing, He said an emissions cap would be included in the China's
next five-year plan, which covers the years 2016-20. The peak will likely come in 2030, he told
Reuters, with China's emissions at about 11f billion metric tons of C02 equivalent.

"The government will use two ways to control C02 emissions in the next five—year plan, by
intensity and an absolute cap." he said.

Yang said part of the Chinese government's strategy includes using advisers to ﬂoat policies
before they are official and called He's comments significant. Others, though, noted that the
Chinese government has given no indication that an official policy is forthcoming.

Mixed signals

”There are a handful of scholars in China who are really important to the [climate change] policy
discussion," and He is one of them. said Joanna Lewis, an assistant professor at Georgetown
University and expert on Chinese energy policy. But, she noted, "Their academic work is
certainly influential to policy. It doesn‘t set policy."

The comments also sparked a wave of inaccuracies. A number of news outlets reported that the
cap would come in 2016; others erroneously described He's comments as China‘s official
emissions pledge to the U.N. climate change treaty talks.

Yang Fuqiang, a senior adviser on energy and climate change at the Natural Resources Defense
Council in Beijing, said, “I think Reuters misinterpreted He Jiankun’s point. He did not say China
will set a total emissions cap in 2016. He said China will set the cap in the nation’s next five-year
development plan, which ranges from 2016 to 2020."

Indeed, by evening yesterday. He had backpedaled, telling Reuters that his comments had been
only his "personal view."

He could not be reached by ClimateWire for comment.

Still, climate analysts said that whether or not He’s statements were an indication of policy to
come, China does have major new policies in the works.

Lewis noted that last year, for the first time ever, the country known for building "a power plant
per week" installed more non-fossil-fuel power capacity than fossil-fuel capacity. Meanwhile,

she said. the government in light of devastating air pollution problems is considering a total cap
on coal consumption by 2020. That, she noted, opens the door to a peak emissions year.

NRDC's Yang agreed, saying that He's predictions are also in line with his expectations. He said
that if China's coal consumption peaks by 2020, which many researchers believe will happen.
there is near certainty that emissions will then peak by 2030.

"The possibility that China's coal consumption will peak by 2020 is very high," he said. "In the
past, there was no consensus among government institutes, companies and the general public in
terms of reducing coal use. But since air pollution has become a crisis in China, we have that
consensus now," Yang said. "The central government has exerted so much effort, spent so much
money and got the Chinese society on its side. If this still can't bring a peak on coal
consumption, 1 don‘t know what can."

In Bonn, Germany, where diplomats are meeting for a midyear U.N. climate negotiating session,
both the U.S. power plant targets and the suggestion from China were greeted with
circumspection by representatives of the countries most affected by climate change.

”We welcome the emission reduction announcements by the two top GHG emitters, because
these provide high hopes for the success of 2015 agreement," Prakash Mathema, who leads the
group of least-developed countries in the negotiations. told Climate Wire.

But he said both possible targets, "whilst useful, may not be enough to put the world on a less-
than~2—degree-Celsius pathway. So we look forward to further improvements in these policies,
and announcements from other big emitters, as well."

Behind the Mask —- A Reality Check on China’s Plans for a Carbon Cap

By ANDREW REVKIN

plans-for-a-carbon-cap/

BEIJING — Having covered China’s stance on global warming since 1988, I’ve gotten attuned
to the need to tread carefully when something is said that feels like a shift in the official position
of this greenhouse gas giant.

The ancient Chinese mask—changing dance that I saw here Tuesday night (at a dinner for
participants in a meeting on science and sustainable development) came to mind in considering
the unraveling of news a few hours earlier of an official Chinese plan for a firm cap on emissions

of carbon dioxide, hard on the heels of President Obama’s proposed carbon pollution rules for
existing American power plants.

Here’s how things played out. An adviser to the Chinese government on climate change was
Quoted by Reuters as saying the following at a Beijing climate—policy conference on Tuesday:

The government will use two ways to control CO2 emissions in the next five-year plan. by
intensity and an absolute cap.

The comment came from He Jiankun, a professor at Tsinghua University and deputy director of
China’s Expert Committee on Climate Change, speaking at an international forum on market
mechanisms for low-carbon development sponsored by Tsinghua and Harvard University.

 The story quickly pivoted to how significant this would be given the context of President
Obama‘s move and informal climate talks starting on Wednesday in Bonn, Germany, aimed at
setting the stage for fresh climate treaty work later this year at the United Nations and in Lima.
Peru.

The Guardian quickly followed Reuters with “China Pledges to limit Carbon Emissions for the first 
time,” a piece canvassing climate campaigners but offering no reinforcing input from the
Chinese government.

I consulted with The Times’s Beijng bureau. Christopher Buckley, a reporter [based in Hong
Kong] who in 2011 had covered China‘s emissions plans [and similar pushes from advisers to
adopt a cap] while with Reuters, spoke with He Jiankun, who told him repeatedly that he did not
in any way speak for the government, or the full expert climate committee.

Here’s Buckley’s translation:

It’s not the case that the Chinese government has made any decision. This is a suggestion from
experts, because now they are exploring how emissions can be controlled in the 13th five Year
Plan... This is a View of experts; that’s not saying it"s the government‘s, I’m not a government
official and I don’t represent the government.

A Reuters reporter told me tonight that a correction was being posted [it’s berg], but not before
other newspapers — including USA Todav with a piece on China’s “emissions pledge“ — built on
the report.

Other, more recent news coverage has reﬂected that this isn’t China‘s position, although many
experts in Beijing (including at the meeting I‘m participating in) foresee an eventual cap and a
peak in China’s emissions sometime after 2030.

Here’s more from other news outlets. The China News Service, a state-run news agency, also
reported on the comments made by Professor He at the Tsinghua-Harvard forum but made no
mention of proposals for a quantitative cap on carbon dioxide emissions.

Page 277

The financial Times posted “China climate adviser urges emissions cap.”

Recalling that all energy forecasts need to be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism, best
guesses for a peak in China’s greenhouse gas emissions tend to center on the 20305, as reﬂected
in this paper earlier this year in the journal Energy Policy: “Peak energy consumption and CO2
emissions in China.”

Here’s the abstract:

China is in the processes of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Based on the Kaya identity
[a formula drawing on economic activity: energy use and other factors to determine a country’s
Greenhouse-gas impact], this paper proposes an analytical framework for various energy
scenarios that explicitly simulates China’s economic development, with a prospective
consideration on the impacts of urbanization and income distribution. With the framework,
China's 2050 energy consumption and associated C02 reduction scenarios are constructed. Main
findings are: (1) energy consumption will peak at 5200—5400 milliontons coal equivalent (Mtce)
in 2035~2040; (2) C02 emissions will peak at 92007-9400 million tons (Mt) in 2030~2035, whilst
it can be potentially reduced by 200—300Mt: (3) China’s per capita energy consumption and per
capita C02 emission are projected to peak at 4tce and 6.8t respectively in 2020—2030, soon after
China steps into the high income group.

Things could potentially speed up, as some have noted. but there are limits to the pace at which
China can develop enough cleaner energy alternatives to cutback on coal burning. Professor He
noted this in the Reuters article:

He said China’s greenhouse gas emissions would only peak in 2030, at around 1 1 billion tonnes
of CO2-equivalent. Its emissions currently stand at around 7-9.5 billion tonnes. But He said that
would depend on China achieving a real reduction in coal consumption from sometime around
2020 or 2025, and on the nation meeting its target of having l50-200 gigawatts of nuclear power
capacity by 2030. The share of non-fossil fuels in China‘s energy mix would reach 20 to 25
percent in 2030, He added.

Once an emissions peak and rough timeline are clearer, you can be sure a cap will be announced
— but only when the trajectories are already in place to make it a sure bet.

We‘re already locked in for substantial human driven climate change, but the intensifying focus
on a post—fossil future in both China and the United States points to a real prospect that much of
the world‘s remaining coal will stay in the ground in the end.

emissions, click back to my interview last fall with Zen Ji, the deputy director of China’s
National Center for Climate Change Strategy.
