Behind the Mask —- A Reality Check on China’s Plans for a Carbon Cap

BEIJING — Having covered China’s stance on global warming since 1988, I’ve gotten attuned
to the need to tread carefully when something is said that feels like a shift in the official position
of this greenhouse gas giant.

The ancient Chinese mask—changing dance that I saw here Tuesday night (at a dinner for
participants in a meeting on science and sustainable development) came to mind in considering
the unraveling of news a few hours earlier of an official Chinese plan for a firm cap on emissions

of carbon dioxide, hard on the heels of President Obama’s proposed carbon pollution rules for
existing American power plants.

Here’s how things played out. An adviser to the Chinese government on climate change was
Quoted by Reuters as saying the following at a Beijing climate—policy conference on Tuesday:

The government will use two ways to control CO2 emissions in the next five-year plan. by
intensity and an absolute cap.

The comment came from He Jiankun, a professor at Tsinghua University and deputy director of
China’s Expert Committee on Climate Change, speaking at an international forum on market
mechanisms for low-carbon development sponsored by Tsinghua and Harvard University.

 The story quickly pivoted to how significant this would be given the context of President
Obama‘s move and informal climate talks starting on Wednesday in Bonn, Germany, aimed at
setting the stage for fresh climate treaty work later this year at the United Nations and in Lima.
Peru.

The Guardian quickly followed Reuters with “China Pledges to limit Carbon Emissions for the first 
time,” a piece canvassing climate campaigners but offering no reinforcing input from the
Chinese government.

I consulted with The Times’s Beijng bureau. Christopher Buckley, a reporter [based in Hong
Kong] who in 2011 had covered China‘s emissions plans [and similar pushes from advisers to
adopt a cap] while with Reuters, spoke with He Jiankun, who told him repeatedly that he did not
in any way speak for the government, or the full expert climate committee.

Here’s Buckley’s translation:

It’s not the case that the Chinese government has made any decision. This is a suggestion from
experts, because now they are exploring how emissions can be controlled in the 13th five Year
Plan... This is a View of experts; that’s not saying it"s the government‘s, I’m not a government
official and I don’t represent the government.

A Reuters reporter told me tonight that a correction was being posted [it’s berg], but not before
other newspapers — including USA Todav with a piece on China’s “emissions pledge“ — built on
the report.

Other, more recent news coverage has reﬂected that this isn’t China‘s position, although many
experts in Beijing (including at the meeting I‘m participating in) foresee an eventual cap and a
peak in China’s emissions sometime after 2030.

Here’s more from other news outlets. The China News Service, a state-run news agency, also
reported on the comments made by Professor He at the Tsinghua-Harvard forum but made no
mention of proposals for a quantitative cap on carbon dioxide emissions.

The financial Times posted “China climate adviser urges emissions cap.”

Recalling that all energy forecasts need to be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism, best
guesses for a peak in China’s greenhouse gas emissions tend to center on the 20305, as reﬂected
in this paper earlier this year in the journal Energy Policy: “Peak energy consumption and CO2
emissions in China.”

Here’s the abstract:

China is in the processes of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Based on the Kaya identity
[a formula drawing on economic activity: energy use and other factors to determine a country’s
Greenhouse-gas impact], this paper proposes an analytical framework for various energy
scenarios that explicitly simulates China’s economic development, with a prospective
consideration on the impacts of urbanization and income distribution. With the framework,
China's 2050 energy consumption and associated C02 reduction scenarios are constructed. Main
findings are: (1) energy consumption will peak at 5200—5400 milliontons coal equivalent (Mtce)
in 2035~2040; (2) C02 emissions will peak at 92007-9400 million tons (Mt) in 2030~2035, whilst
it can be potentially reduced by 200—300Mt: (3) China’s per capita energy consumption and per
capita C02 emission are projected to peak at 4tce and 6.8t respectively in 2020—2030, soon after
China steps into the high income group.

Things could potentially speed up, as some have noted. but there are limits to the pace at which
China can develop enough cleaner energy alternatives to cutback on coal burning. Professor He
noted this in the Reuters article:

He said China’s greenhouse gas emissions would only peak in 2030, at around 1 1 billion tonnes
of CO2-equivalent. Its emissions currently stand at around 7-9.5 billion tonnes. But He said that
would depend on China achieving a real reduction in coal consumption from sometime around
2020 or 2025, and on the nation meeting its target of having l50-200 gigawatts of nuclear power
capacity by 2030. The share of non-fossil fuels in China‘s energy mix would reach 20 to 25
percent in 2030, He added.

Once an emissions peak and rough timeline are clearer, you can be sure a cap will be announced
— but only when the trajectories are already in place to make it a sure bet.

We‘re already locked in for substantial human driven climate change, but the intensifying focus
on a post—fossil future in both China and the United States points to a real prospect that much of
the world‘s remaining coal will stay in the ground in the end.

emissions, click back to my interview last fall with Zen Ji, the deputy director of China’s
National Center for Climate Change Strategy.
