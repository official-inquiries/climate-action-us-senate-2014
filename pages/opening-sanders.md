OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BERNARD SANDERS, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT 

Senator SANDERS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank 
you for your tireless efforts on this issue and for organizing this 
very important hearing today. 

I say this as somebody who may have the highest pro-labor vot-
ing record in the U.S. Congress, my delight in hearing some of my 
friends on the other side express their interest about the needs of 
low income people, working people and senior citizens. 
I would remind everyone that many of these same people are 
folks who have fought to cut social security, Medicare, Medicaid, 
opposed raising the minimum wage, opposed the kind of jobs pro-
gram we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and put mil-
lions of people back work and opposed lowering college debts for 
many struggling students in this Country. 

The issue we are dealing with today is of enormous importance. 
It really comes down to whether as a Nation, as the most powerful 
nation on earth, we are going to listen to the science. When we 
build weapons systems that cost billions of dollars, we take it for 
granted that the engineers know what they are talking about. 
When we invest in cancer research through the National Institutes 
of Health, we assume and believe that the doctors and scientists 
know what they are talking about. 

Right now, we are in a very strange moment in American his-
tory. That is why traditionally there are differences of opinion on 
labor issues, on health care issues and that is what happens year 
after year. We are now in a very strange moment and that is we 
have virtually an entire political party that is rejecting basic 
science and the science is no longer in doubt. 

Some 97 percent of scientists who have written in peer-reviewed 
journals say the following. Climate change is real, it is significantly 
caused by human activity, and it is already causing devastating 
problems in our Country and throughout the world. 

Yesterday, the newspapers reported that in Arizona, they are 
worrying about how Phoenix and other cities are going to get water 
because of the terrible drought we have seen in the southwest. 
Australia is burning up. We have had extreme weather disturb-
ances, major storms that have cost us billions and billions of dol-
lars. Sea levels are rising which may flood among other cities, the 
great city of New Orleans, New York City and Boston. 
For some strange reason, while we agree on science in almost 
every area of our life, in this area we have a party that says, no, 
climate change is not real; it is maybe a hoax, something concocted 
by Al Gore or Hollywood. 

I am very proud today and want to thank the panelists who are 
here very much, especially the former EPA Administrators who 
were appointed by Republicans. I thank you so much for being here

because while we can disagree on a million issues, we should not 
disagree on what scientists tell us. We should not disagree when 
scientists tell us that we have a window of opportunity, 10 or 15 
years, to turn this thing around, to lead the world. 
John Kerry said the rest of the world has to go forward. He is 
right but somebody has got to lead. This Country leads. By the 
way, when we lead in transforming our energy system away from 
fossil fuel, we create millions of jobs through weatherization, 
through energy efficiency, through wind and solar, geothermal and 
other technologies that are out there. 

I very much want to thank the former Republican Administra-
tors for coming to Washington to say what I think is true nation-
ally, that intelligent Republicans all over this Country—I am not 
a Republican, my views are very different—but on this issue we 
can at least respect science, we can respect the planet, we can 
transform our energy system and most importantly, maybe at the 
end of the day, we have a moral responsibility for our children and 
grandchildren so that 30 years from now, they do not look us in 
the eye and say, all the scientists told you what was going on, why 
didn’t you do something. We have to do something. 
I thank you all very much for being here this morning. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Sanders. 

Senator Inhofe.
