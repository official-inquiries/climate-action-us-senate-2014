## OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID VITTER, 
## U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA 

I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses here today, 
certainly including Dr. Daniel Botkin, Dr. Joseph Mason and Hon. 
Luther Strange. 

The science and economic consequences and legal underpinnings 
of the EPA’s actions to advance the President’s climate action plan 
are topics the Administration does not want to discuss in detail. 
However, their unilateral actions will increase America’s elec-
tricity bills, decrease family disposable income and result in real 
job losses for little or no measurable impact on our ever changing 
climate. 

On June 2, EPA proposed an unprecedented rule targeting our 
Country’s electricity system. Using a provision in the Clean Air Act 
that has only been used five times in 40 years, EPA requires States 
to set performance standards that apply to the entire electricity 
system, mandating renewable energy and rationing energy on 
which families and businesses rely. 

EPA argues that this rule is a gift to States that provides States 
with flexibility. In reality, that is a complete red herring. States 
are forced into achieving questionable emission reduction targets 
from a limited menu of economically damaging and legally ques-
tionable options. 

States are left little choice but to join or create regional cap and 
trade programs which achieves the Administration’s goal of making 
sure we all pay more for energy. 

Electricity prices right now in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Ini-
tiative States and California are 45 percent higher than in my 
home State of Louisiana. Fifty-six percent of Louisiana families al-
ready spend at that lower rate an average of 21 percent of their 
after tax income on energy. They simply cannot afford the higher 
electricity bills that will inevitably result from this rule. 
The rule is billed as climate change mitigation with America 
leading the way. Unfortunately, anyone who has actually read the 
645 page rule finds it has no material effect on global average tem-
perature or sea level rise. The major of the benefits touted by EPA 
come from double accounting reductions of other emissions already 
regulated through other measures.

While this Administration expects other governments to consider 
the global consequences of their greenhouse emissions when regu-
lating, there is absolutely no reason to presume the world’s biggest 
emitters will follow us down this path of economic destruction. 
In fact, much of the world is changing course. Our friends in Eu-
rope have adopted similar carbon constraining frameworks several 
years ago, filled with government mandates and cronyism and were 
rewarded with harsh economic pain. 

In an effort to recover, Germany is lifting its ban on fracking and 
increasing the use of coal. Spain is abandoning the handouts that 
supported its renewable energy program. Instead of embracing our 
domestic energy resources and the bright economic light they pro-
vide in our otherwise poor economy, this climate action plan moves 
us beyond coal and beyond natural gas with serious negative con-
sequences. 

Today, the American electricity system provides affordable, reli-
able power, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to families, schools, 
hospitals and businesses. The existing source rule as proposed will 
increase costs to all consumers significantly. As always, that espe-
cially hits the poor, the elderly and those on fixed incomes for no 
measurable effect on climate change. 

In reality, this rule is essentially a Federal takeover of the Amer-
ican electricity system. Is everyone here really comfortable with the 
EPA being fully, completely responsible for all of those details of 
our electricity system? 

The only thing missing from this strategy is an empty promise 
from the President. If you like your affordable energy, you can keep 
your affordable energy. We like it, we want to keep it. This rule 
will destroy it. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Vitter. 

I will turn now to the wonderful Chairman of the Environment 
and Public Works Committee, who I am very honored to have here 
today, a great leader in this effort, Barbara Boxer.
