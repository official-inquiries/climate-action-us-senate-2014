## OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING 

Senator BARRASSO. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
As you know, I am from Wyoming, the most beautiful State in 
the Nation and I want to keep it that way. I believe we have and 
can have a healthy environment and a health economy at the same 
time. We need to do that by striking the right balance between the 
two. 

I believe it is irresponsible to impose costly regulations without 
having real environmental benefits. The cost of these climate 
change regulations on families and on communities is very real. 
The benefits are ill defined. They are unknown or are simply neg-
ligible. 

President Obama’s new climate regulations, which are at the 
heart of his climate action plan, will harm our fragile American 
economy, thousands of people will lose their jobs, it will raise elec-
tricity prices threaten electricity reliability and undermine Amer-
ica’s global competitiveness. 

Higher energy costs will hurt low income families and fixed in-
come seniors the most, leaving them with less to spend on food, 
housing, health care and other basic necessities. The thousands of 

Page 19 

unemployed and their families will suffer negative health impacts 
as a result of chronic unemployment. Electricity prices and hospital 
visits will necessarily sky rocket. 

Is it worth subjecting many in our Country to a dramatically 
lower quality of life and health for this plan to essentially nation-
alize our electricity grid? Based on the facts, I would say absolutely 
not. 

We have been told by the U.N. and the EPA that climate change 
will cause serious impacts across the globe. To address this, the 
President put forward his Climate Action Plan. This plan is two-
fold: first, to have the U.S. nationalize our electricity grid just as 
he has tried to nationalize our healthcare system. 
Nationalizing our electricity grid means taking decisionmaking 
about electricity policy out of the hands of the States, out of the 
hands of the communities and putting it in the hands of Wash-
ington bureaucrats. 

This will occur as EPA rejects in whole or in part State energy 
plans for reducing carbon emissions and imposing their own Fed-
eral plans under the EPA’s proposed new regulations for existing 
coal-fired power plants. This will happen at a cost of thousands of 
jobs and the public’s health and well being. 

The second part of the President’s plan is to have us believe that 
he can arrive in Paris in 2015 at the U.N. Climate Change Con-
ference and convince the world to follow his lead. The whole plan 
hinges on President Obama’s foreign policy prowess. His foreign 
policy record is a series of empty threats, pivots, resets, missed cal-
culations and lead from behind failures in places like Syria, Russia, 
Iran, Libya and now Iraq. 

After all those missteps, the President expects Americans to be-
lieve that in 2015, he can draw a red line along the Champs- 
Elyseesys and demand that China and India stop burning fossil 
fuels. Even if the President was able to reach an agreement like 
the Kyoto treaty of the 1990’s, it would still have to be ratified by 
the Senate. The treaty in the 1990’s overwhelmingly failed in the 
Senate. 

If the President cannot deliver in Paris and subsequently in the 
Senate, we will be left with his domestic climate action plan. 
Americans have been told by the EPA and the U.N. that climate 
change will cause serious impacts to the planet years into the fu-
ture. The President’s domestic climate action plan they champion 
cannot, on its own, prevent these impacts from happening. 

According to our own U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, in a 
column he wrote in the Financial Times on June 3, he stated, 
‘‘Even as we strive to do better, we recognize that no country can 
solve this problem alone.’’ Even if the U.S. somehow eliminated all 
our domestic greenhouse gas emissions, Secretary Kerry says, ‘‘It 
would not be enough. The rest of the world is spewing too much 
carbon pollution.’’ 

That means that the President’s climate action plan, on its own, 
doesn’t reduce global temperatures or prevent any of the serious 
impacts predicted by the U.N. or the EPA. It can’t even make a 
dent, all the while seniors on fixed incomes, families and children 
suffer high electricity bills, joblessness and poor health.

This is all pain and little gain with what the President is pro-
posing.
