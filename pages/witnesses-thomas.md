Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you very much, Mr. Reilly. 
We now turn to former Administrator Thomas. Welcome. 
STATEMENT OF LEE M. THOMAS, FORMER ADMINISTRATOR, 
U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 

Mr. THOMAS. Thank, Mr. Chairman, Senator Sessions and mem-
bers of the subcommittee for holding the hearing and giving me an 
opportunity to offer a perspective on climate change based upon my 
experience at EPA dealing with many complex environmental 
issues during the Reagan years. 

I have approached the issue using a risk assessment and risk 
management process. This is the approach we used during my time 
at EPA as we addressed a range of environmental problems. 
Whether it was assessing the impact of stratospheric ozone de-
pletion caused by chlorofluorocarbons or the impact of lead and 
gasoline on children’s health, scientific data and analysis was the 
first step in evaluating the risk posed by the problem. 

During my 6 years at EPA, I dealt with many contentious issues, 
first, as Assistant Administrator for 2 years and later as Adminis-
trator for a little over 4 years. I cannot remember any other mat-
ters I dealt with during that 6 year period of time that were not 
controversial—some more than others. 

The issue of climate change is one that the EPA and the global 
scientific community have studied and analyzed for decades, 
whether it is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or 
the latest scientific valuation that was authorized by Congress, the 
National Climate Assessment. 

There appears to be clear evidence regarding climate change and 
its anthropogenic foundation. We know that carbon dioxide con-
centrations in the atmosphere have increased by 40 percent since 
pre-industrial times. 

We know that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are 
warming the atmosphere. We know they have contributed to a 
more than 1–1/2 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures 
since the 1880’s. 

We know global sea level has risen by an average of 8 inches 
since 1870, primarily from thermal expansion caused by warmer 
oceans and some melting of glaciers on the Greenland and West 
Antarctic ice sheets. 

We know that ocean acidification is occurring, harming our coral 
reefs and marine ecosystems and we know that communities in our 
Country are dealing today with the effects of changing climate. 
In the State of Florida where I live, we see increasing salt water 
intrusion infiltrating our drinking water supply along the coast due 
to sea level rise. We see coastal communities dealing with the im-
pact of sea level rise on their drainage systems. A major part of the 
systems in south Florida are being impacted. 

The economic impact is undeniable and the local governments 
struggle to address today’s impacts of climate change while trying 
to anticipate the increased risk in the future is real. 

On a broader scale, scientific analysis of the issue points to wide-
spread impacts across our Country. They range from the depleted 
shellfish harvest in the Pacific Northwest that Bill mentioned due 
to ocean acidification or to increased drought and wildfires in the

southwest the National Climate Assessment Report suggested were 
linked to climate change. 

Given this assessment of the impacts and risks posed by global 
warming, EPA has the responsibility given to it by Congress and 
affirmed by the courts to address the risk management challenge. 
We know there are many approaches that can be taken and we also 
know that all of them are controversial. 

We know the gases we have emitted will remain in the atmos-
phere for decades to centuries and recognize that the solution will 
require a long term commitment if we are to mitigate both the ef-
fects already occurring and those forthcoming. 

We also know what many of the solutions are, some of which, 
Senator Sessions, you mentioned such as improving energy effi-
ciency and increasing our reliance on low emission energy produc-
tion. Widespread adoption of strategies like these can supplement 
an international agreement to reduced emissions. 

In addition, a coordinated national and international approach is 
needed to assist States and countries in implementing adaptation 
measures dealing with the impacts of climate change already tak-
ing place today. 

Clearly more action is needed to address the impacts today while 
addressing the larger issue of committing ourselves to avoiding 
dangerous levels of future warming. The recent steps taken by the 
EPA to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are significant mitigation 
measures and once again position the U.S. to demonstrate inter-
national leadership on an issue of global significance and con-
sequence. 

I would suggest if the United States is not taking the leadership 
position that international agreement will never come to fruition. 
Thank you again for the opportunity to present my views to the 
subcommittee on what I consider a critically important issue.

Statement of the Honorable Lee M. Thomas
Former Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
before the
United States Committee on Environment and Public Works
Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety
Washington, D.C.
June 18, 2014

Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the deliberations of this
Subcommittee.

I am pleased to be here to offer a perspective on climate change based upon my experience at the
Environmental Protection Agency dealing with similar issues. I've approached the issue using a
risk assessment and risk management process. This is the approach I used during my time at
EPA as we addressed a range of environmental problems.

Whether it was assessing the impact of stratospheric ozone depletion caused by
Chlorofluorocarbons, or the impact of lead in gasoline on children’s health, scientific data and
analysis were the first step in evaluating the risk posed by the problem.

During my six years at the Environmental Protection Agency I dealt with many contentious
issues first as Assistant Administrator and later as Administrator. As Assistant Administrator,
challenges involved implementing the new Superfund statute and working with Congress on
reauthorizing and putting into effect law on the disposal of hazardous waste and leaking
underground storage tanks. Then as Administrator, addressing major environmental issues. I
can’t remember any of the matters I dealt with during my tenure at the Environmental Protection
Agency that were not controversial some more so than others, ranging from setting safe drinking
water standards to clean air requirements.

The issue of climate change is one that the EPA and the global scientific community have
studied and analyzed for decades. And since my time as Administrator, the assessment of risk
global warming poses to public health and the environment has continually improved and
become more certain. Whether it is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or the latest
scientific valuation authorized by Congress, the National Climate Assessment, there is clear
evidence regarding climate change and its anthropogenic foundation.

We know that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by 40 percent
since pre—industrial times.

We know that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are warming the atmosphere,
contributing to a more than 15°F rise in global temperatures since 1880.

We know global sea level has risen by an average of eight inches since 1870 primarily from
thermal expansion caused by warmer oceans and the melting of glaciers and the Greenland and
West Antarctic ice sheets.

We know that ocean acidification is occurring. harming our coral reefs and marine ecosystems.
Absorbing about a quarter of our emissions each year, the current rate of acidification is roughly
50 times faster than known historical change.

We know that communities in our country are already dealing with the effects of the changing
climate today. In my state of Florida. we see increasing salt water intrusion infiltrating our
drinking water supply due to sea level rise. Coastal communities are dealing with the impact sea
level rise is having on their drainage systems, resulting in an investment of more than $300
million to upgrade flood mitigation infrastructure in Miami Beach alone. The economic impact is
undeniable, and local governments struggle to address today‘s impacts of climate change while
trying to anticipate the increased risk it poses in the future.

On a broader scale, scientific analysis of the issue points to widespread impacts across our
country. They range from depleted shellfish harvests in the Pacific Northwest due to ocean
acidification, to increased drought and wildfires in the Southwest and a more than 70 percent rise in the occurrence of heavy downpours in the Northeast since the late 1950s.

Given this assessment of the impacts and risk posed by global warming, the EPA has the
responsibility given to it by Congress, and affirmed by the courts, to address the risk
management challenge. We know there are many approaches that can be taken. and all are
controversial. We know the gases we have emitted will remain in the atmosphere for decades to
centuries, and recognize that the solution will require a long-term commitment if we are to
mitigate both the effects already occurring and those forthcoming.

But we also know what many of the solutions are, like improving energy efficiency and
increasing our reliance on low-emission energy production. Widespread adoption of strategies
like these can supplement an international agreement to reduce emissions. In addition, a
coordinated national and international approach is needed to assist states and countries
implement adaption measures dealing with the impacts of climate change already taking place
today.

Clearly more action is needed to address the impacts today while addressing the larger issue of
committing ourselves to avoiding dangerous levels of future warming. The recent steps taken by
the EPA to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are significant mitigation measures and once again
position the US to demonstrate international leadership on an issue of global significance and
consequence.

Thank you again for the opportunity to present my views to the Subcommittee on this critically
important issue.
