STATEMENT OF WILLIAM D. RUCKELSHAUS, STRATEGIC ADVI-
SOR, MADRONA VENTURE GROUP AND FORMER ADMINIS-
TRATOR, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 

Mr. RUCKELSHAUS. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Ses-
sions and other members of the subcommittee for convening this 
hearing on a matter of enormous importance for our future. 
I am pleased to be here and reassure at least of you that I am 
still alive.

Several months ago after talking with one another, the four 
former EPA Administrators sitting in front of you found we were 
convinced by the overwhelming verdict of scientists that the earth 
was warming and that we humans were the only controllable con-
tributor to this phenomenon. 

Given those facts, we all signed an op-ed piece that America get 
serious about reducing our contribution to changing the world’s cli-
mate rather than simply sitting back and accepting the avoidable 
consequences. 

If anything, new reports in the last several months have made 
the need to act even more urgent. It is hard to believe that there 
is any question of that. The International Panel on Climate Change 
report validates in the strongest terms the science of climate 
change and projected impacts. 

The National Climate Assessment documents impacts occurring 
here in this Country right now. A report from the CMA Corpora-
tion, made up of retired military officers, highlights the national 
security and military readiness concerns due to climate change. 
We have, as EPA Administrators, served four Presidents over 
four decades. We have successfully wrestled with a variety of public 
health and environmental problems, all contentious, including se-
vere automobile, industrial and air pollution, widespread water pol-
lution and the unacceptable effects of pesticides like DDT. 
We have made progress. We cut our automobile emissions, for ex-
ample, by 95 percent and greatly improved air quality while the 
number of cars has doubled. The hole in the ozone layer and acid 
rain are under control. 

Inherent in all of these problems was uncertain science and pow-
erful economic interests resisting controls. The same is true of cli-
mate change. In all cases cited, the solutions to the problems did 
not result in the predicted economic and social calamity. Scientific 
uncertainty or the inevitable industry resistance does not mean 
that nothing should be done unless we are willing to suffer the con-
sequences of inaction. 

We believe there is legitimate scientific debate over the pace and 
effects of climate change but no legitimate debate over the effect 
of the earth’s warming or man’s contribution. The models of the 
world’s leading scientists predict rising seas, drought, floods, 
wildfires and more severe and frequent storms. Those are the pro-
jections and predictions of these models. 

We are seeing impacts already. Since the ocean absorbs 25–30 
percent of the carbon from stationary or mobile sources, we thought 
the ocean was our friend. It was, keeping significant amounts of 
carbon from the atmosphere. Our friend is paying a penalty. 
The carbon from the burning of fossil fuels is causing the acidity 
of the ocean to rise and is already threatening shellfish, coral reefs 
and other ocean species. The culprit is the same carbon that origi-
nated from fossil fuels that is contributing to planetary warming. 
I was the co-chairman of a committee in my home State of Wash-
ington appointed by the Governor to look at the impacts of ocean 
acidification on Puget Sound which directly threatened the shell-
fish industry in Puget Sound that contributes $275 million a year 
to the State’s economy. 

Page 49 

To find out what the nature of the problem was and taking steps 
to both adapt to it and try to reduce the amount of carbon in Puget 
Sound has begun to have some beneficial effect. 

We also know that if America does not get serious about our re-
sponsibility to deal with this problem, nothing much will happen 
in the rest of the world. No action is a choice. It is a choice that 
means we leave to chance the kind of future we want and opt out 
of the solution to a problem that we are a big part of. 

We like to speak of American exceptionalism. If we want to be 
truly exceptional, then we should begin the difficult task of leading 
the world away from the unacceptable effects of our increasing ap-
petites for fossil fuels before it is too late. 
This is an extremely complex problem whose solutions are not 
straightforward. We believe this is no excuse for the complacency 
or not stepping up to our responsibility.

Testimony of William D. Ruckelshaus Before the Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee
U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works

June 18th, 2014

Thank you Senators Whitehouse, Sessions and other members of the Subcommittee for convening this hearing on a matter of
enormous consequence for our future.

Several months ago, after talking with one another, the four former EPA administrators sitting in front of you found we were convinced by the overwhelming verdict of scientists that the earth was warming and that we humans were the only controllable contributor to this phenomenon. Given those facts we all signed an op ed piece that recommended that America get serious about reducing our contribution to changing the world’s climate rather than simply sitting back and accepting the avoidable consequences.

If anything, new reports in the last three months have made the need to act even more urgent. It is hard to believe that there is any question of that.

The IPCC report validates in the strongest terms the science of climate change and the projected impacts.

The National Climate Assessment documents impacts occurring here in this country right now.

And a report from the CNA Corporation highlights the national security and military readiness concerns due to climate change.

Page 51

We have, as EPA administrators, served four Presidents over four decades. We have successfully wrestled with a variety of public health and environmental problems, all contentious, including severe automobile and industrial air pollution, widespread water pollution and the unacceptable effects of pesticides like DDT.

We have made progress. We have cut automobile emissions, for example, by 95% and greatly improved air quality while the number of cars has doubled. The hole in the ozone layer and acid rain are under control.

Inherent in all of these problems was uncertain science and powerful economic interests resisting controls. The same is true of
climate change. In all of the cases cited the solutions to the problems did not result in the predicted economic and social calamity. Scientific uncertainty or the inevitable industry resistance does not mean that nothing should be done unless we are willing to suffer the consequences of inaction.

We believe there is legitimate scientific debate over the pace and effects of climate change but no legitimate debate over the fact of the earth’s warming or over man’s contribution. The models of the world’s leading scientists predict rising seas, drought, floods, wildfires, and more severe and frequent storms. We are seeing impacts already. Since the ocean absorbs 25—30% of the carbon from stationary or mobile sources we thought the ocean was our friend. It was keeping significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. But our friend is paying a penalty. The carbon from the burning of fossil fuels is causing the acidity of the ocean to rise and is already threatening shellfish, coral reefs and other ocean species. The culprit is the same carbon that originated from fossil fuels that is contributing to planetary warming.

We also know that if America does not get serious about our responsibility to deal with this problem nothing much will happen in the rest of the world. Not taking action is a choice. it is a choice that means

Page 52

we leave to chance the kind of future we want, and opt out of the solution to a problem that we are a big part of.

We like to speak of American exceptionalism. If we want to be truly exceptional then we should begin the difficult task of leading the world away from the unacceptable effects of our increasing appetites for fossil fuels before it is too late.

This is an extremely complex problem whose solutions are not straightforward. We believe this is no excuse for complacency or not stepping up to our responsibility.

Responses from William D Ruckelhaus
to questions from U.S. Senate. Committee on Environment and Public Works
July 23, 2014

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse

1. Before many environmental regulations are applied, dire consequences and worst
fear outcomes are usually perpetuated. How did the worst fears and assumptions of
bad outcomes from environmental regulations turn out in reality as the rules were
applied in your own experience?

In my experience when major regulations have been proposed, those opposed to them cite the high
costs of compliance, economic and social, should they be implemented. The
motivation to emphasize and perhaps to exaggerate those costs, is natural.

It is also my experience that when such regulations become final after hearings and extensive comment,
the motivation of those affected focus on driving down the costs of compliance
through new technologies and other means.

I cannot recall any situation in my tenures when predictions of catastrophic costs
as a result of a regulation ever materialized. 

Senator Jeff Sessions:

1. What do you think should be the role of nuclear power in America’s generating mix?

Nuclear power with its improvement in safely and reduction in costs should play an important role in developing an American Energy policy for the future.


Senator David Vitter:

 

1. Author environmental activist Bill McKibben has written that “you can have a healthy fossil fuel industry or a healthy planet, but you can't have both.” Do you agree with this statement?

 

Page 54

No. This is not an either or situation. As we have seen from other resource and
environmental challenges, there is great potential in new technology that will allow us
responsibly to use such resources even as we move to a low—carbon economy.

Page 55

2. Mr. McKibben has also written that “one way to fight the power of fossil fuel companies is to stop using fossil fuel.” Do you think this is realistic for consumers, in light of the fact that, as the International Energy Agency noted, “Despite all the
attention given to renewable energy, fossil fuels still produce about four-fifths of the energy consumed worldwide?” Moreover, by 2050, the IEA projects that, even with its most aggressive carbon reduction scenario, fossil fuels would still provide 45 percent of global energy demand. Do you agree with this projection? More broadly, do you agree that, even as countries take steps to reduce carbon emissions, fossil fuels will continue to comprise a substantial portion of the global energy mix ill the
coming decades?

I have not done any independent analysis of these projections by the International Energy Agency. It is a highly regarded. independent institution whose research is relied upon by governments and others around the world. Fossil fuels will undoubtedly be in the mix of energy sources in the years ahead. Prudence suggests to me that we should rapidly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels so as to reduce the risks of climatic change.

3. Mr. McKibben has written that a “huge problem with increased reliance on cheap
natural gas: it undercuts the transition to zero—carbon energy sources like solar and
wind power, locking us into long-term reliance on fossil fuels." Do you agree with
this statement? Do you believe that “reliance on cheap natural gas” has been
harmful or helpful to the U.S. economy, particularly for consumers and
manufacturers?

Clearly access to low—cost natural gas has been helpful to the economy. Certainly the use of natural gas, from the perspective of climate change, is better than the use of coal or oil, absent any kind of carbon controls. The larger issue, however, involves the absence of a national energy policy that sets a long—term agenda to reach a low-carbon economy to meet the challenges of a changing climate. We, as a nation. would be far better of with such an energy policy, instead of the ad hoc approach we now take.

4. Activist Naomi Klein wrote that “with the fossil—fuel industry, wrecking the planet is their business model. It’s what they do.” Do you agree with this statement?

No.

5. On November 3, 2013, climate scientists Kerry Emanuel, Tom Wigley, James Hansen, and Ken Caldeira, in an open letter to environmentalists, disputed the notion that world energy demand could be met with 100 percent renewables. Nuclear, they contend, must be part of the equation: “Renewables like wind and solar and biomass will certainly play roles in a future energy economy, but those energy sources cannot scale up fast enough to deliver cheap and reliable power at the scale the global economy requires. While it may be theoretically possible to

Page 56

stabilize the climate without nuclear power, in the real world there is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power.” Do you agree with the authors of this statement?

I agree that in a future low-carbon economy, nuclear power will play an important role. This is especially true given the current absence of storage technology that would address concerns about renewable power generation. I note, again, however, that the absence of any comprehensive national energy policy makes achieving our future energy goals more difficult and more expensive.

6. According to Ted Nordhaus and Michael Schellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute, “Whatever their merits as innovation policy, Germany’s enormous solar investments have had little discernible impact on carbon emissions. Germany’s move away from baseload zero~carbon nuclear has resulted in higher coal consumption since 2009. In 2012. Germany’s carbon emissions rose 2 percent. Do you agree with this statement? Do you believe the U.S. should deploy more nuclear instead of relying on renewables to provide baseload power?

I think we should, going forward, push renewables very hard and include nuclear power
in the mix.

7. According to an analysis by the Economist magazine, renewable energy targets in Germany are popular, but their economic consequences are not. As the Economist explained, consumers “increasingly dislike” the “side-effects” of subsidizing
renewable energy. “first, there is the rising cost of electricity. This is a consequence of a renewable-energy law passed in 2000 which guarantees not only 20 years of fixed high prices for solar and wind producers but also preferred access to the electricity grid. As a result, Bavarian roofs now gleam with solar panels and windmills dominate entire landscapes. Last year, the share of renewables in electricity production hit a record 23.4%.”

The Economist explained further, “This subsidy is costly. The difference between the market price for electricity and the higher fixed price for renewables is passed on to the consumers, whose bills have been rising for years. An average household now pays an extra €260 ($355) a year to subsidize renewables: the total cost of renewable subsidies in 2013 was €16 billion. Costs are also going up for companies, making them less competitive than rivals from America, where energy prices are falling thanks to the fracking boom.”

Do you believe that Germany’s renewable energy policies have delivered zero-carbon energy without harming consumers? Do you believe that states, as they attempt to meet EPA’s emissions targets under the proposed Clean Power Plan for existing power plants, can both deploy more renewable energy while doing so without raising the cost of electricity, or imposing higher costs to consumers?

Page 57

We should examine all subsidies granted to energy production and use and determine which are moving us toward lower carbon in the most cost effective way possible.

8. Do you think the U.S. drilling boom, spurred by the technological advance of hydraulic fracturing, coupled with horizontal drilling, has been positive or negative for the U.S. economy, particularly for consumers?

In the short term the United States economy has definitely benefited from hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Developing a sound energy policy also entails looking at potential long-term costs of refusing to factor in the risks of climatic alteration. A careful examination of climate risks will show significant potential environmental and national security costs as well as economic ones.

9. Do you think EPA’s Clean Power Plan will have a meaningful effect on reducing global greenhouse gas concentrations by 2030? Please explain how the Clean Power Plan will prevent rising sea levels, droughts, wildfires, and severe weather.

EPA’s Clean Power Plan will not solve the problem of climate change. No single step will. America must lead or the combination of effective and efficient steps by the world will not materialize

10. Albert Einstein once famously stated that “the right to search for truth implies also a duty; one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be true.” Do you agree with this statement?

I do agree with the Einstein quote. My answers to questions i through ix would be the same as Mr. Reilly‘s as the sources I would rely on would be the same. Therefore I incorporate by reference Bill Reilly’s responses.

11. As you are at least tangentially aware, fossil resources provide the base molecules and products that we need to manufacture virtually everything we use in a modern society. In fact, coal combustion byproducts are what comprise, strengthen and make possible our roads and infrastructure. Chemicals derived from oil and natural gas production are what are refined and manufactured into virtually every product we use today, from computers to our homes, and are what make possible Wind turbines (all components derived, manufactured or refined from fossil fuels) and solar panels (all components derived, manufactured or refined from fossil fuels). Accordingly, many claims about eliminating our use of fossil resources are wholly illusory. However, in order to provide a better understanding of some of your claims regarding our nation’s dependence on these resources, other than counting intermittent electricity generation as a product, please provide a comprehensive list of all the things that are a product or can be manufactured out of sunlight and wind (again, please exclude electricity).

Page 58

The sun. through the process of photosynthesis (see answer to Q. 20), creates directly, and indirectly the food that sustains life on this planet.

The wind. harnessed by early explorers, led to the discovery of much of the Western Hemisphere including America. in the absence of electricity. wind also provided the power to run machinery throughout the world.

12. As EPA Administrator, you acted to ban DDT. Were you ever advised against taking action on banning DDT due to the science on DDT health effects?

The decision was based on balancing the risks of the continued use of DDT against the benefits in the United States. I decided the risks outweighed the benefits — not all agreed.

The reasons for this are spelled out in my decision. (Attachment 1 to this response.)

13. Were you associated with any environmental organization at the time of your decision?

No. and never while at EPA.

14. In what year did you first start fundraising for the Environmental Defense Fund? And how much money in total would you estimate you’ve helped raise for EDF?

I have never raised money for EDF.

15. In 2006 the World Health Organization! lifted the ban on DDT. The toll of the ill-advised ban following EPA’s lead was measured in human lives (millions dead-mostly pregnant women and children under the age of 5), illness (billions sickened) and poverty (more than $1 trillion dollars in lost GDP in sub-Saharan Africa alone). Do you have any regrets for your decision?

My decision, under the terms of the statute I administrated, affected only the United States, where malaria was not an issue. Of course the Congress did not direct me to strike this balance for any other country and i did not.

16. Did you disagree with the WHO‘S decision on DDT? If so, please explain why and what science you use to support your disagreement.

The WHO recommended the use of DDT in 2006 to control malarial mosquitos in those countries where malaria is a problem. As i have said many times, had I been so charged, I would have made the same decision.

17. In your own estimates, how many people have died as a result of your banning of DDT?

Where the decision applied (the US.) none have died to my knowledge.



18. Has the EPA ever made any other decisions on a chemical that resulted in more deaths than your banning of DDT?

See answer to #17.

19. Are you still affiliated with any environmental organization now? If so. which organizations?

I am Chairman Emeritus of the World Resources Institute.

20. Please explain the process of photosynthesis.

New Oxford Dictionary defines photosynthesis as the following:

The process by which green plants and some other organisms use Sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water.

21. How many parts per million (ppm) do humans inhale of C02 when they breathe? How many ppm do humans exhale when they breathe?

I have no data on this question.

22. Of all the “pollutants” regulated by the Clean Air Act and EPA, please provide a list of all those humans exhale at a greater rate than they inhale and at what rate in ppm are they exhaled?

I have no data on this question

23. It has been claimed about you that “it was, of course, then-Environmental Protection Agency administrator William Ruckelshaus who actually banned DDT after ignoring an EPA administrative law judge’s ruling that there was no evidence indicating that DDT posed any sort of threat to human health or the environment. Ruckelshaus never attended any of the agency‘s hearings on DDT. He didn’t read the hearing transcripts and refused to explain his decision.

None of this is surprising given that, in a May 22, 1971 speech before the Wisconsin Audubon Society, Ruckelshaus said that EPA procedures had been streamlined so that DDT could be banned. Ruckelshaus was also a member of — and wrote a
fundraising letter for — the EDF”.

Please explain which if any of the above statements you disagree with and why.

(See attachment i) In that decision. as stated, I specifically weighed the risks of the continued use of DDT against the benefits. That‘s what the statute directed me to do. The opinion speaks for itself on this subject. In writing the decision I made extensive use of the transcripts of the earlier hearingss before the administrative law judge. I was, in effect,

Page 60

under the statute. acting as an Appellate Judge. It would not have been appropriate for me to sit in while the ALJ was conducting his proceedings.

I sat through the entire two day argument appealed to me as Administrator — consistent with the procedure laid out in the statute. My decision was unanimously affirmed upon appeal to the DC Court of appeals on December 13, l973 as supported by “substantial evidence”. (See attachment ii the Court of Appeals decision).

I have never raised money for EDF or said “EPA procedures had been streamlined so that
DDT could be banned.”

24. Do you believe environmental activists groups should be held liable for false claims
similarly to the way businesses are held accountable for false claims?

Everyone, including members of Congress, should be held accountable for false claims.
Whether this creates legal liability depends on the facts surrounding the claim.

25. Please explain if you disagree with any of these statements and why:

“Finally, there is the question of the World Health Organization itself. What’s the WHO been doing for all these years? There are no new facts on DDT ~— all the relevant science about DDT safety has been available since the 1960s. Moreover, the WHO’S strategy of mosquito bed nets and malaria vaccine development has been a dismal failure. While the death toll in malarial regions has mounted, the WHO has been distracted by such dubious issues as whether cell phones and French fries cause cancer. It‘s a relief that the WHO has finally come to its senses, but on the other hand, the organization has done too little, too late. The ranks of the WHO’S leadership need to be purged of those who place the agenda of environmental elitists over the basic survival of the world’s needy.”

I am not familiar with the operations of the WHO so I can’t help you on this question.

PANEL:
[*1]
Before the Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Opinion by William D. Ruckelshaus

OPINION OF THE ADMINISTRATOR

This hearing represents the culmination of approximately three years of intensive administrative inquiry into the uses of DDT. Part I sets forth the background of these proceedings and Part H contains a discussion of the evidence and law and my factual conclusions. I am persuaded for reasons set forth in Part III of this opinion that the long-range risks of continued use of DDT for use on cotton and most other crops is unacceptable and outweighs any benefits. Cancellation for all uses of DDT for crop production and non-health purposes is hereby reaffirmed and will become effective December 31, 1972, in accordance with Part V of this opinion and the accompanying order, except that certain uses, for green peppers, onions, and sweet potatoes in storage may continue on terms and conditions set forth in Part V of this opinion and the accompanying order.

I

A. BACKGROUND

DDT is the familiar abbreviation for the chemical (1,1,1, trichlorophenyl ethane), which was for many years the most widely used chemical pesticide in this country. DDT’s [*2] insecticidal properties were originally discovered, apparently by accident, in 1939, and during World War II it was used extensively for typhus control. Since 1945 DDT has been used for general control of mosquitos, boll weevil infestation in cotton»growing areas, and a variety of other uses. Peak use of DDT occurred at the end of the 1950‘s and present domestic use of DDT in various formulations has been estimated at 6,000 tons per year. n1 According to Admission 7 of the record, approximately 86% or 10,277,258 pounds of domestically used DDT is applied to cotton crops. The same admission indicates that 603,053 pounds and 937,901 pounds, or approximately 5 and 9% of the total formulated by twenty-seven of the petitioners in these hearings are used respectively on soybean and peanut crops. All other uses of the 11,966,196 pounds amount to 158,833 of the total, or little over 1 percent. n2

n1 Admission 6 shows that domestic shipments of DDT by its sole manufacturer, Montrose Chemical Company, totaled 8,827,900 pounds between January 1 and August 1, 1971. Total domestic sales in 1970 were 11,966,196, as stipulated in Admission No. 7. The Examiner found, apparently based on Admission 7, that domestic use in 1970 "was just under 12 million pounds." Exam. Report at 92.

Counsel for the Agency has called to our attention publication of the Department of Agriculture, The Pesticide Review of 1971, which estimates "a domestic disappearance" rate of 25,457 pounds for DDT in 1970. See p. 24. The motion to incorporate this publication is granted, as is the motion by registrants to supplement the record, see infra. I do not believe, however, that the Pesticide Review figure can be accepted, on its face, without further explanation. Since the result I reach today would, if anything, only be reenforced by the higher figure, I see no need to remand. [*3]

n2 Some discrepancy in the figures exists since the figures given in breakdown of use categories total

Page 62

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; l E.A.D. 9

11,977,065 pounds, slightly more than the total sold by the twenty-seven formulators who supplied figures. For the above uses it appears that DDT is sold in four different formulations: emulsifiable sprays; dust; wettable powder; and granular form.

Public concern over the widespread use of pesticides was stirred by Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring, and a natural outgrowth was the investigation of this popular and widely—sprayed chemical. DDT, which for many years had been used with apparent safety, was, the critics alleged, a highly dangerous substance which killed beneficial insects, upset the natural ecological balance, and collected in the food chain, thus posing a hazard to man, and other forms of advanced aquatic and avian life. In 1969 the United States Department of Agriculture commenced a review of the health and environmental hazards attendant to the use of DDT.

Certain uses of DDT were canceled by the Department of Agriculture in 1969 and informal review of remaining uses continued {*4] through 1970. n3 In early 1971 this Agency commenced formal administrative review of DDT registrations by the cancellation of all registrations for DDT products and uses pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (fiFRA) 7 U.S.C. § 135 (1972). n4

n3 PR Notice 69—17. Among the canceled uses were applications to trees for control of Dutch Elm disease, tobacco, home uses, and aquatic uses. 34 Fed Reg. 18827 (1969).

n4 In Environmental Defense Fund v. Ruckelshaus. 439 F.2d 584 (DC. Cir. 1971), the Court of Appeals held that cancellation proceedings should be commenced whenever a registration of a pesticide raises a "substantial question of safety" which warrants further study. On January 15, 1971, all uses of DDT not canceled in 1969 were canceled. PR Notice 71-1. And on March 18, 1971, notices of cancellation were issued for all registered uses of 'I'DE, a DDT metabolite. PR Notice 71-5.

[*5]
B. STATEMENT OF THE CASE
This hearing is the final stage of formal administrative review. n5 Thirty-one registrants have challenged fifteen of the canceled uses of DDT and its metabolite, TDE. n6 These uses of DDT include applications to cotton fields to control the boll weevil and bollworm, applications to various vegetable crops, and a variety of lesser uses in public programs. The case for cancellation has been presented by counsel for the Pesticides Office of the Environmental Protection Agency and attorneys for the Environmental Defense Fund which is an intervenor. Other parties include Eli Lilly & Co, which held a DDT registration for "topocide," a prescription drug, n7 H. P. Cannon & Son, 3 user of DDT, n8 and representatives of the chemical manufacturing industry and various wildlife groups. n9

115 Under fiFRA a registrant is entitled to either a public hearing or a scientific advisory committee or both to
review his registration. Pending completion of that review, a registrant is allowed to continue shipment of his product.

n6 Unless specified, discussion of DDT in this opinion applies to TDE. DDT has three major breakdown products, DDA, DDE, and DDD; separate registrations exist for TDE (DDE). [*6]

n7 There has been some controversy over Eli Lilly's status because it failed to appeal cancellation of its registration within 30 days as required by Section 4(c) of fiFFA. For the purposes of this case I believe they should be accorded status as parties.

n8 There has been some question as to whether or not a "user" has standing to appeal a cancellation and thus seek reinstatement of a canceled use even though no registrant has stepped forward to appeal. The same reasoning employed by the court in Environmental Defense Fund vi Ruckelshaus, supra, and Environmental Defense Fund v. Hardin, 428 F.2d 1093 (I).C. Cir. 1970), which accords standing to ”public interest" groups gives "users" a right to appeal a cancellation.

n9 The groups are: National Agricultural Chemicals Association; National Audubon Society; The Sierra Club; and West Michigan Environmental Action Council. As already noted, the Secretary of Agriculture, in addition to being a party-registrant by virtue of registrations held by its Plant Regulation Division, has appeared as an intervenor.

{*7}
The testimony and exhibits cover in exhaustive fashion all aspects of DDT‘s chemical and toxicological properties. The evidence of record, however, is not so extensive concerning the benefits from using DDT, and most of it has been directed to the major use, which is on cotton crops. n10

Page 63

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, ‘; l E.A.D. 9
n10 "the following uses are involved: for cotton; for military use on clothing; for peppers and pimentos; for fresh market corn; for peanuts; for cabbage, cauliflower, and brussel sprouts; for tomatoes; for lettuce; for potatoes; for sweet potatoes in storage (southern states only); for use in commercial greenhouses and nurseries; for beans (dry, lima, snap); for bat and rodent control; for emergency use for agriculture, health or quarantine purposes; and for onions and garlic; and for lice control. There has been considerable controversy as to what uses were at issue during the hearing. Admission No. 2 sets forth those uses which the Department of Agriculture considers essential. Many of those uses have been canceled and no appeal was taken. The uses at issue in this hearing are only those noted in Admission ll.

[‘8]
The Pesticides Office and Environmental Defense Fund (EDP), in presenting their cases against continued registration for DDT, lean most heavily on evidence which, they contend, establishes: (1) that DDT and its metabolites are toxicants which persist in soil and the aquasphere; (2) that once unleashed, DDT is an uncontrollable chemical which can be transported by leaching, erosion, run-off and volatilization; (3) that DDT is not water-soluble and collects in fat tissue; (4) that organisms tend to collect and concentrate DDT; (5) that these qualities result in accumulations of DDT in wildlife and humans; that once stored or consumed, DDT can be toxic to both animals and humans, and in the case of fish and wildlife inhibit regeneration of species; and (7) that the benefits steming from DDT usage are marginal, given the availability of alternative insecticides and pest management programs, and also the fact that crops produced with DDT are in ample supply. The testimony and exhibits include numerous reports of expert scientists who have described observed effects of DDT in the environment and the laboratory.

Group Petitioners and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [*9] seek to discredit the Agency‘s case by citing the record of safety DDT has compiled throughout the years, and point to the negative findings of epidemiological and human feeding studies carried out over the years on industrial workers and volunteers exposed to concentrated levels of DDT far in excess of that to which the average individual is exposed. Proponents of continued registration have also introduced expert testimony to the effect that DDTs chronic toxicity to man or animals has not been established by adequate proof. The registrants have attacked the assumption that laboratory data, as to effects of exaggerated doses of DDT, can provide a meaningful basis for extrapolating effects on man or the environment. In the alternative, Group Petitioners contend that whatever harm to the environment might be attributed to DDT, it results from misuse and overdosing that occurred in years past. Lastly, Group Petitioners and USDA have attempted to prove that DDT is effective and that its use is more desirable than the organophosphates which are more acutely toxic and costly than DDT.

On April 25, the Hearing Examiner issued an opinion with proposed findings, conclusions and orders [n10] recommending that all “essential" uses of DDT be retained and that cancellation be lifted. [n11] The Examiner‘s report which has findings, conclusions and an opinion, is attached as an appendix. The Examiner apparently accepted in his report the Agency's proof that DDT is a hazard to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife and substitutes exist, He found, as a "matter of fact," DDT can have adverse effects on beneficial animals; that it is transferred through the food chain; that DDT is fat soluble. He concluded, however, as a “matter of law," that DDT is neither a carcinogen nor teratogen, that the particular uses at issue do not adversely affect wildlife, that DDT use has rapidly declined. Examiner's Rept. p. 93.

[n11] There is some confusion as to what the term "essential" means. By Admission number 2 the parties stipulated that certain uses were "essential" in the view of USDA. No stipulation exists that these uses are, in fact, essential in that no alternatives exist or that a shortage of a crop would result without DDT.

The Pesticides Office of this Agency and intervenor Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed exceptions to the Examiner's report, n12 challenging his application of the burden of proof to this case, his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and numerous evidentiary rulings. Exception was also taken to the Examiner’s application of the so—called "risk and benefit" standard of fiFRA.

[n12] Exceptions have also been received in Docket 106, In Re Wallerstein. Stark Bros. Nurseries held a registration for use of DDT on nursery plants. The Examiner recommended cancellation on the grounds that this was not an "essential" use according to USDA.

On May 2, 1972, the Judicial Officer propounded by order, at my direction, a series of questions for briefing and discussion at oral argument, and oral argument was held on May 16. That argument was transcribed and is part of this record. Group Petitioners, USDA, Eli Lilly and HP. Cannon & Sons have also responded to the briefs on exceptions.

A. APPLICABLE LAW

The [‘12] basic fiG scheme has been outlined in court opinions and Agency decisions (see EDF v. EPA, DC, Cir. Slip. Op. 71-1365, fiZd , May 5, 1972) (Opinion of Judge Leventhal); Steam: Elec. Paste Co. v. EPA, 7th Cir. Slip Op. No. 71-1112, F.2d , May 11, 1972; Continental Chemist Co v. EPA, 7th Cir. Slip Op. No. 714828, FZd , May 1 1, 1972; EDF v. Ruckelshaus (Opinion of Judge Bazelon), supra; Statement of Reasons concerning the Registration of Products Containing DDT, 2,4,S-T, and Aldrin/Dieldrin, March 18, 1972; In re Hari-Kari Lindane Pellets, et al., L.F.&R. No. 6 (1971). While there is no need to trace in detail once again the statutory scheme, a brief summary provides a useful prism for filtering the evidence.

1. FIFRA

The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, 7 USC, § 135 (1972), establishes a strict standard for the registration of pesticides. Any "economic poison" which cannot be used without injury to ”man or other vertebrate animals, vegetation, and useful invertebrate animals" is "misbranded", n13 and is therefore subject to cancellation [‘13] n14

n13 Sections 2(2) (2)(c), (d) and (g), respectively provide: The term ‘misbranded' shall apply»

(a) to any economic poison
***

(c) if the labeling accompanying it does not contain directions for use which are necessary and if complied with adequate for the protection of the public;

(d) if the label does not contain a warning or caution statement which may be necessary and if complied with adequate to prevent injury to living man and other vertebrate animals, vegetation, and useful invertebrate animals;

***

(g) if in the case of an insecticide, nematocide, fungicide, or herbicide when used as directed or in accordance with commonly recognized practice it shall be injurious to living man or other vertebrate animals, or vegetation, except weeds, to which it is applied, or to the person applying
such economic poison;

n14 Section 4 permits the Administrator to cancel a registration "if it appears that 'the article and its labeling “ *" do not comply with [the Act]'." Since the Act prohibits distribution of a "misbranded" pesticide, Section 3(a)(5), the registration for a "misbranded" product may be canceled.

1*14}

While the language of the statute, taken literally, requires only a finding of injury to non«target species, the inquiry cannot, however, end with a simplistic application of this plain statutory language. Both judicial and administrative precedent recognize that Congress intended the application of a balancing test, that would measure the risks of using a particular chemical against its benefits. n15 if a product is "misbranded" within the meaning of the Act, 112,, if it bears a label for use that does not meet the criteria of Section 2, it may no longer be shipped in interstate commerce and
stocks in hand in the original package may be seized, 7 U.S.C. § 135(g) (1972)

n15 See EDF v. EPA (Opinion of Judge Leventhal), supra; EDF v. [Ruckelshaus (Opinion of Judge Bazelon), supra, DDT Statement of Reasons, supra; see also Statement of Reasons Underlying Suspension and Cancellation of Products Containing Mercury, 37 Fed. Reg. 6419 (1972).

[‘15]

2. RISKS AND BENEfiTS

It follows from the statutory scheme and this Agency‘s decisions that evidence of each alleged risk must be reviewed and a conclusion reached as to whether or not, and in what degree, such risk is incident to the directed use of a particular product. The task, however, is complicated in the case of a "persistent " pesticide by its possible chronic effects. The degree of persistence, extent of overall usage and mobility all bear on the amplitude or indeed the existence of the risk curve, n16 I believe, however, it is useful to isolate the alleged risks and evaluate each on the

Page 65

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; 1 HAD. 9

assumption that they are unaffected by overall levels of use, and defer to Part IV the discussion of the significance of the relationship between risk and overall use.

n16 Other factors bearing on risk may include the geographical location of application, see, 2g, Statement of Reasons Underlying Registrations for Strychnine, 1080, and Sodium Cyanide, 37 Fed. Reg. 5718 0972), although this may not be as significant where the chemical is highly volatile as is the case with DDT. See also Statement of Reasons Underlying the Cancellation of Mirex, Determination and Order of the Administrator at 7, 32 Fed. Reg. 106 (June 1, 1972).

A. ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE

1. RISKS

a. Health Effects and Environmental Properties. There is no dispute on this record that DDT is a non-specific chemical that kills both target and non-target species in the immediate area of application. Few chemicals, however, are so selective that they can be used without causing some injury to "non-target" species. We must therefore proceed to the evidence bearing on other "risks" and the "benefits" from using DDT.

I am convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that, once used DDT is an uncontrollable, durable chemical that persists in the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Given its insolubility in water and its propensity to be stored in tissues, it collects in the food chain and is passed up to higher forms of aquatic and terrestrial life. There is ample evidence to show that under certain conditions DDT or its metabolites can persist in soil for many years, n17 that it will volatilize or move along with eroding soil. n18 While the degree of transportability is unknown, evidence of record shows that it is occasionally found in remote areas or in ocean species, such as whales, far from any known area of application. ['17]

n17 Method of application and type of soil and climate can affect persistence in soil and likewise run-off into aquatic areas.

n18 Registrants have made much of the fact that aquatic contamination and the spread of DDT have resulted from drift during aerial application. While the Examiner's Report dwells at some length on improved methods of application, it recognizes rim-off as a significant source of aquatic contamination, even with improved aerial spraying techniques.

Persistence and biomagnification in the food chain are, of themselves, a cause for concern, given the unknown and possibly forever undeterminable long-range effects of DDT in man, and the environment. n19 Laboratory tests have, however, produced tumorigenic effects on mice when DDT was fed to them at high levels. n20 Most of the cancer research experts who testified at this hearing indicated that it was their opinion that the turnorigenic results of tests thus far conducted are an indicator of carcinogenity and that DDT should be considered a [* 18] potential carcinogen.
n21

n19 It is particularly difficult to anticipate the long—range effects of exposure to a low dose of a chemical, It may
take many years before adverse effects would take place. Diseases like cancer have an extended latency period.
Mutagenic effects will be apparent only in future generations. Lastly, it may be impossible to relate observed
pathology in man to a particular chemical because of the inability to isolate control groups which are not
exposed in the same degree as the rest of the population.

n20 Tumorigenic effects have been noted in a number of laboratory experiments. The most positive results were
developed by the Bionetics Study and the Lyons and Milan tests. The Bionetics Study of the National Cancer
Institute fed 120 compounds to two strains of mice, DDT was one of 11 compounds to produce an elevated
incidence of tumors. The Lyons and Milan Studies of the International Agency for Research of the World Health
Organization is a multigenerational study (still in progress) of 6,000 mice of in and outbred strains. Increased
hepatomas were noted in male and female mice fed DDT at 250 ppm Metastasis to the lungs or kidneys has
been recorded in five instances. [*19]

n21 Witnesses testifying to the positive correlation between tumorigens and carcinogens were Dr. Umberto
Safftotti, Associate Scientific Director for Carcinogenesis, Etiology Area, National Cancer Institute; Dr. Marvin
Schneidcrman, Associate Chief, Biometry Branch and Associated Director for Demography, National Cancer
Institute; Dr. Samuel Epstein, Senior Research Associate in Pathology, Children's Cancer Research Foundation,

Inc, Boston.

Group Petitioners argue that the testimony is in conﬂict and fasten on to the testimony of the Surgeon General and
that of Drs. Loomis and Butler. The Surgeon General‘s Statement was, however, cautious and, by no means, carries
the burden that the Group Petitioners seek to place on it. In very general terms the Surgeon General stated: “We have
no information on which to indict DDT either as a tumorigen or as a carcinogen for man and on the basis now
available, I cannot conclude DDT represents an imminent health hazard." (Tr. 1350.) This testimony, however, does
not bear on the long-term effects of DDT, nor did the Surgeon General express a view on [*20} what uses, apart from
health uses, would justify continued use of DDT. Indeed, the entire thrust of the Surgeon General's testimony was
only that use for immediate health needs outweighs the possible long—range effects of DDT on human health. Group
Petitioners' other witnesses, Drs. Loomis and Butler, while men of stature in their fields—~toxicology and
pathology--and knowledgeable about cancer treatment and diagnosis, are not specialists in cancer research as is Dr.
Saffiotti. Indeed. Dr. Butler disclaimed such expertise.

Group Petitioners also take refuge under a broad canopy of data--human feeding studies and epidemiological
studies—and support it with the increasingly familiar argument that exposure to any substance in sufficient quantities
may cause cancer.

None of the feeding studies carried out with DDT have been designed adequately to detect carcinogenicity; and given
the latency period of cancer, these studies would have to be carried out for a much longer period. Statistical
population samples for epidemiological studies are also virtually impossible given the latency period for cancer and
the long-term exposure of the general population. Since there is no sharp distinction [*21] between population groups
exposed to low doses and higher doses of DDT, adequate control groups cannot be established. The ”everything is
cancerous argument" falls because it ignores the fact that not all chemicals fed to animals in equally concentrated
doses have produced the same turnorigenic results.

b. Environmental Effects. The case against DDT involves more, however, than a long-range hazard to man's health.
The evidence presented by the Agency's Pesticides Office and the intervenors, EDF, compellingly demonstrates the
adverse impact of DDT on fish and birdlife. Several witnesses testified to first—band observed effects of DDT on fish
and birdlife, reporting lethal or sub-acute effects on aquatic and avian life exposed in DDT—treated areas. Laboratory
evidence is also impressively abundant to show the acute and chronic effects of DDT on avian animal species and
suggest that DDT impairs their reproductive capabilities. n22

n22 See the testimony of Drs. Tarzwell, Nicholson, Philip Butler, Duke, Burdick, Dirnond, Risebrough, Hickey,
and Code.

While the Examiner erroneously excluded testimony as to economic losses caused by DDT‘s contamination of
the aquatic environment--losses to commercial fishermen caused by inability to market contaminated fish-- this
risk is significant, even if it could not he could not be economically quantified. Not all risks can be translated
into dollars and cents, nor can all benefits be assessed in cash terms.

[‘22]
The Petitioner-registrants' assertion that there is no evidence of declining aquatic or avian populations, even if actually
true, is an attempt at confession and avoidance. It does not refute the basic proposition that DDT causes damage to
wildlife species. Group Petitioners‘ argument that DDT is only one toxic substance in a polluted environment, and
thus, whatever its laboratory effects, it cannot be shown to be the causative agent of damage in nature, does not
redeem DDT, but only underscores the magnitude of effort that will be necessary for cleaning up the environment.
Were we forced to isolate in nature, rather than in the laboratory, the effects of various toxic substances, it would be
difficult if not impossible to make a judgment as to the chronic effects of any chemical. As our DDT Statement of
March, 1971, has noted: "Development of adequate testing protocols and facilities is a priority undertaking. But in the
short term, extrapolation from small-scale laboratory analyses must err on the side of safety." See DDT Statement of
Reasons, at 11.

Finally, I am persuaded that a preponderance of the evidence shows that DDE causes thinning of eggshells in certain
bird species. [‘23] The evidence presented included both laboratory data and observational data. Thus, results of
feeding experiments were introduced to show that birds in the laboratory, when fed DDT, produced abnormally thin
eggshells. hi addition, researchers have also correlated thinning of shells by comparing the thickness of eggs found in
nature with that of eggs taken from museums. The museum eggs show little thinning, whereas eggs taken from the
wild after DDT use had become extensive reveal reduced thickness,

Group Petitioners and USDA argue that the laboratory feeding studies, conducted with exaggerated doses ofDDE and
under stress conditions, provide no basis for extrapolating to nature. They suggest that the study results are
contradictory and place particular emphasis on documents which were not part of the original record and the
inconsistencies in Dr. Heath's testimony as brought out during cross-examination. Group Petitioners also contend that

Page 67

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, ‘; l E.A.D. 9
the observed phenomenon of eggshell thinning and DDE residue data are tied by a statistical thread too slender to
connect the two in any meaningful way.
Viewing the evidence as a total picture, a preponderance supports the conclusion that DDE [‘24] does cause eggshell
thinning. Whether or not the laboratory dam above would sustain this conclusion is beside the point. For here there is
laboratory data and observational data, and in addition, a scientific hypothesis, which might explain the phenomenon.
n23

n23 The chief witness introduced to rebut Drs. Risebrough, Hickey and Cade was a graduate student with
limited training in statistical analysis. In view of the credentials of EDF’s witnesses and Hickey, Professor of
Wildlife Ecology at College of Agriculture, University of Wisconsin; Dr. Rosebrough, Associate Ecologist,
University of California at Berkeley; and Dr. Cade, Professor of Zoology at Cornell and Research Director of
Cornell Ornithology Laboratory-J cannot credit this attempt at rebuttal.

The Hearing Examiner apparently resolved the conflict in the evidence by concluding that "there was no
evidence that DDT was the only factor in a decline of bird populations ‘ * *" and that no evidence ”focused its
direct thrust on damage to birds by the uses of DDT that are permitted under the registrations in question.“
Examiner's Report, 70-71. In view of DDTs persistence and mobility, evidence as to the causal effect of these
uses was not required. -

At argument and by motion Group Petitioners have offered additional evidence, some of which bears on the
issue of eggshell thinning. I have granted that motion and considered all that data,

[‘25]

B. Benefits

1. Cotton

I am convinced by the evidence that continued use of DDT is not necessary to insure an adequate supply of cotton at a
reasonable cost. Only 38% of cotton—producing acreage is treated with DDT, although the approximately 10,277,258
pounds used in cotton production is a substantial volume of DDT and accounts for most of its use. The record contains
testimony by witnesses called by registrants and USDA attesting to the efficacy of organophosphate chemicals as
substitutes for DDT and, long-range, the viability of pest management methods, such as the diapause program At
present most areas that use DDT combine it with an organophosphate and toxaphene that use DDT combine it with an
organophosphate and toxaphene in a 42-1 mixture (4 lbs. toxaphene, 2 DDT, 1 methyl parathion). Some areas,
however, according to the testimony, which normally use DDT occasionally apply concentrated methyl parathion in a
4-11). mixture.

There is evidence that organophosphates would not raise costs to the farmer and might, indeed, be cheaper. Any
suggestion that the organophosphates are not economically viable cannot be maintained in face of the undisputed
evidence that [‘26] cotton continues to be tenable crop in Arkansas and Texas where DDT use has declined. n24
There is also testimony in the record to the effect that methyl parathion costs less per application than the
DDT-toxaphene formula. Nor are the testimony and exhibits that show cotton insects develop resistance to
organophosphate chemicals to the point. The very same exhibits make clear that DDT is also subject to resistance. n25

n24 The parties have referred neither in briefs nor argument to testimony or exhibits describing in detail the
economics of cotton production or substitutes. There is general testimony that cotton producers receive a per
bushel subsidy and that this subsidy is the difference between profit and break-even, It is not clear whether or
not breakeven includes a return to the farm owner in terms of salary or return on his investment. While some
evidence suggests that organophosphates are more costly, because of higher price and the need for repeated
applications in concentrated quantities, there is little to suggest that the possible increased variable cost from use
of organophosphates would be a disincentive to producers. Indeed, with subsidies it is not clear what rate of
return a cotton producer receives for invested capital. There was a reference made to an unidentified study
showing that the cost of using substitutes would involve $ 15 million, This figure alone has no meaning. While
later testimony suggests that elimination of DDT would increase variable costs per acre by 5%, this, too, is of
limited significance since the record does not relate it to the support program and the study looked at only a
limited area. [‘27]

n25 I cannot accept the suggestion that we should continue to use DDT until it is good to the very last drop.
Whatever the long-term efficacy of the organophosphates the fact remains that they generally work. While the
fact of insect resistance is important and underscores the need for retaining a variety of chemicals or methods to
manage the same pest problem, this fact does not justify an avoidable use of a harmful chemical.

Page 68

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; 1 BAD. 9

Group Petitioners and USDA, While not disputing the lesser persistence of organophosphates, have stressed their
demonstrated acute toxicity. While they are toxic to beneficial soil insects and non-target species, particularly birds
alighting on treated fields, these organophosphates break down more readily than DDT. They apparently are not
transported in their toxic state to remote areas, unlike DDT which has been found far from treated areas, and
consequently do not pose the same magnitude of risk to the aquasphere. Both testimony and exhibits also demonstrate
that organophosphates are less acutely toxic to aquatic life, although different compounds have different toxicities.
[‘28) The effect of organophosphates on non-target terrestrial life can, unlike the effects of DDT, also be minimized
by prudent use. Application in known nesting areas for rare or extinct birds can be avoided.

2. Other Crop and Produce Uses

The testimony of record, while sparse, shows that registered alternatives, primarily organophosphates, exist for all
other crop and ornamental uses of DDT, except for storage use on sweet potatoes to control weevils, on heavy corn
borer infestations of green peppers, and perhaps onions. n26

n26 Toxaphene and diazinon are registered for control of cutworms but it is not clear from the record as to
whether or not these chemicals are registered or effective to control cutworm infestations on onions. While none
of the parties have pointed to helpful evidence in connection with use for controlling cutworms on onions and
weevils on stored sweet potatoes, I have taken judicial notice of the non-existence of registered alternatives.

3. Non-Crop Use:

In addition to the registrations [*29] for use on crops and in nurseries, several registrations for non-crop uses are also
in issue. Admission ll lists "public health pests--bats and rodents," "Agricultural, Health and Quarantine Treatments
in Emergencies as Recommended by and Under Direction of State-federal Officials" and "fabric treatment" by the
military.

The record is not, unfortunately, well developed as to the scope or method of application for these uses not as to the
overall volume applied for these purposes. While use for bat and mice control is characterized in Admission 11 as a
"public health use," application for these purposes is not supervised by public health officials. The briefs suggest that
use for control of bats and mice is a proprietary use by the military, even though a private pest control operator
testified that use for bats was considered essential by private operators. n27 With respect to "Agricultural and
Quarantine" uses it is difficult to determine to what extent applications are for health purposes or for nuisance
prevention.

n27 The only evidence as to the amount of DDT used for these purposes was given by Col. Fowler, who said
the-total used by the military for bat and mouse control is approximately 800-900 pounds.

[‘30]

With respect to all of these uses, both for public health programs and proprietary use, alternatives do exist. The Public
Health Service testified that DDT is no longer the chemical of choice for controlling disease vectors. As for mice,
warfarin is used effectively, and fumigation and non-chemical means are available for use on bats. Colonel Fowler
testified that the military has not used DDT in this country for two years for mothproofing purposes and stated that he
was aware of alternatives

C. Weight To Be Accorded the Examiner“: Opinion

in reaching the factual conclusions set forth in the preceding sections, 1 have been mindful of Group Petitioners‘
argument, stressed in their briefs and at oral argument, that the Hearing Examiner‘s findings deserve particular
deference in view of his opportunity to resolve contradictions in testimony based on demeanor evidence.

Nowhere does the Examiner state that his conclusions were based on credibility choices. n28 Whatever extra weight,
then, that might be due findings based expressly on a credibility judgment is not appropriate in the case before me.
See, e.g., NLRB v. Dinion Coil Ca, 201 F.2d 484 (2d Cir. 1952) [‘31] where the Examiner‘s report set forth his
assessment of the witnesses' credibility. n29

n28 During oral argument counsel admitted that the Examiner‘s report did not purport to make findings based on
credibility of witnesses, nor could he point to findings which might be explained in light of a credibility contest.
(Transcript of Argument, p. 9698.) The basic questions of fact in this case, the hazard to man and the
environment, were cast and resolved by the Examiner as "conclusions of law."

n29 The precedents, moreover, make clear that the Agency is free to make its own findings and that the
Examiner‘s findings and report only comprise part of the record which a court will then evaluate. FCC v.
Allentown Broadcasting Corp, 349 U.S. 358 (1955); Universal Camara Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474 (1951).

page 69

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; l E.A.D. 9
Even where an Examiner's findings are based on credibility, the Agency may reach a contrary conclusion. See
FCC v. Allentown Broadcasting Corp, supra.

[‘32]
IV
The application of the risk»benefit test to the facts of record is, by no means, simple. We have noted in our Statement
of March 18, 1971, that the variables are numerous. It should also be home in mind that the variables are not static in
point of time. As build-up of a chemical occurs or is detected in the environment, risk increases. Indeed, it may be that
the same tendency of a chemical to persist or build up in the food chain is present but not known about substitute
chemicals. It may also be that circumspect application of a chemical in limited quantities for those uses most
necessary changes the benefit—risk coefficients so as to tilt the scales differently than when we weigh aggregate use for
all purposes against aggregate benefits. See generally EDF v. EPA (Opinion of Judge Leventhal), supra.

A. Burden of Proof

The crux of a cancellation proceeding is the safety of the product when used as directed or in accordance with
"commonly recognized practice." Steam: Phosphorus Paste Co. v. EPA, supra. This, simply stated, means that this
Agency has the burden of going forward to establish those risks which it believes to require cancellation. ['33] n30
In addition, an affirmative aspect of the Agency's case should be the availability of preferable substitute means of
controlling the pests that are controlled by the canceled chemical where the Agency is relying on this fact to establish
that risks outweigh benefits. n31 Evidence showing the availability of a registered chemical or other means of control
which this Agency‘s Pesticides Office is prepared to recommend as a substitute at that point in time, coupled with the
Agency's proof on risk, makes out an affirmative case. n32

n30 The legislative history of fiFRA, judicial decisions and Agency pronouncements all state that the "burden
of proof" remains on the registrant to demonstrate that his product satisfies the requirements for registration
under the Act. See S. Rept. No. 573 at 5 (88th Cong, lst Sess. 1963); H. Rept. No. 1125 at 4 (88th Cong, lst
Sess. 1963); EDP v. EPA, supra; EDF v, Ruckelshaus, supra; Statement of Reasons, March 18, 1971. There
has, unfortunately, been a great deal of misunderstanding concerning these statements. Simply stated, the burden
of proof referred to by the legislative history is the burden of persuasion which requires a party to establish the
existence of primary facts. It should not be confused with the burden of going forward which is generally a rule
to establish the order for the presentation of evidence. The burden of going forward may, however, have
substantive consequences. Where a party which has the burden of going forward fails to satisfy that burden, the
facts will be decided against him, even though the other party may have been responsible for the burden of
persuasion.

While in most legal proceedings the party which has the burden of going forward bears the burden of
persuasion, this is not necessarily the case. On some issues, like contributory negligence in some jurisdictions, it
may be that once one party has introduced evidence to put the issue in the case, the other party bears the burden
of persuasion on that point. In a fiFRA cancellation hearing the proponent of cancellation hears the burden of
going forward, but does not bear the burden of persuasion. [‘34]

1131 While a mere showing of a high degree of risk would make out a prima facie case for cancellation, where
the Agency is relying on the existence of an alternative rather than simply a showing of risk, it should, as here,
present its own witnesses.

n32 This hearing was conducted under rules which have since been amended. (See 37 Fed. Reg. 9476 (May ll,
1972)). Under the Agency‘s former rules registrants proceeded first at the hearing. This order of presentation,
which is now changed, was not prejudicial in this case. The Agency more than discharged its burden to put on a
prima facie case. Registrants had an ample opportunity for rebuttal. At worst this inverted presentation
unnecessarily protracted the hearing.

The burden of rebuttal then falls on registrants or users. They may either seek to negate the proof on risks either by
rebutting the basic scientific data or by showing that a particular use is so limited as not to engender the risks from
widespread use of the chemical. They can also seek to establish aggregate benefits. Where, as here, the existence
[‘35] of alternatives bears on the benefit of the chemical under review they may choose to show non-viability of
alternatives, either for general substitution or in a particular geographical region. n33 They may also seek to show the
non— desirability (or risks) of the alternative if they disagree with the staff judgment of this Agency.

1133 Where there is a generally viable substitute, which will insure an an adequate crop supply, the non- viability

Page 70

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; 1 E.A.D. 9
of the alternative in a particular area will bear on the advisability of a transition period. See Part IV, infia.

B. Application of Risk—Benefit to Crop User of DDT

The Agency and EDF have established that DDT is toxic to nontarget insects and animals, persistent, mobile and
transferable and that it builds up in the food chain. No label directions for use can completely prevent these hazards.
In short, they have established at the very least the risk of the unknown. That risk is compounded where, as is the case
with DDT, man and animals tend to accumulate and store [*36] the chemical. n34 These facts alone constitute risks
that are unjustified where apparently safer alternatives exist to achieve the same benefit. Where, however, there is a
demonstrated laboratory relationship between the chemical and toxic effects in man or animals, this risk is, generally
speaking, rendered even more unacceptable, if alternatives exist. In the case before us the risk to human health from
using DDT cannot be discounted. While these risks might be acceptable were we forced to use DDT, they are not so
trivial that we can be indifferent to assuming them unnecessarily.

n34 In enacting the present law one of the greatest concerns expressed to Congress was the risk of the unknown.
See Statement of Congressman Dingell. Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Departmental Oversight and
Consumer Relations of the House Committee on Agriculture, at 39 (88th Cong, 1st Sess. 1963).

The evidence of record showing storage in man and magnification in the food chain is a warning to the prudent that
man may be exposing [*37] himself to a substance that may ultimately have a serious effect on his health.

As Judge Leventhal recently pointed out, cancer is a "sensitive and fright-laden" matter and noted earlier in his
opinion that carcinogenic effects are "generally cumulative and irreversible when discovered." EDF v. EPA, Slip Op.
at 12 and 16. The possibility that DDT is a carcinogen is at present remote and unquantifiable; but if it is not a siren to
panic, it is a semaphore which suggests that an identifiable public benefit is required to justify continued use of DDT.
Where one chemical tests tumorigenic in a laboratory and one does not, and both accomplish the same task, the latter is
to be preferred, absent some extenuating circumstances.

The risks to the environment from continued use of DDT in massive quantities are more clearly established. There is
no doubt that DDT run—off can cause contamination of waters and given its propensity to volatilize and disperse
during application, there is no assurance that curtailed usage on the order of 12,000,000 pounds per year will not
continue to affect widespread areas beyond the location of application. The Agency staff established, as well, the

[*3 8] existence of acceptable substitutes for all crop uses of DDT except on onions and sweet potatoes in storage and
green peppers.

Registrants attempted but failed to surmount the evidence of established risks and the existence of substitutes by
arguing that the build-up of DDT in the environment and its migration to remote areas has resulted from past uses and
misuses. There is, however, no persuasive evidence of record to show that the aggregate volume of use of DDT for all
uses in question, given the method of application, will not result in continuing dispersal and build-up in the
environment and thus add to or maintain the stress on the environment resulting from past use. The Department of
Agriculture has, for its part, emphasized DDT‘s low acute toxicity in comparison to that of alternative chemicals and
thus tried to make the risk and benefit equation balance out favorably for the continued use of DDT. While the acute
toxicity of methyl parathion must, in the short run, be taken into account, see infra, it does not justify continued use of
DDT on a long-term basis. Where a chemical can be safely used if label directions are followed, a producer cannot
avoid the risk of his [*39] own negligence by exposing third-parties and the environment to a long-term hazard.
Accordingly, all crop uses of DDT are hereby canceled except for application to onions for control of cutworm,
weevils on stored sweet potatoes, and sweet peppers. Shipments of DDT labeled for those uses may continue on terms
set forth in Part V-A. We defer to Part V-B, infra, consideration of the proper timing of cancellation of other uses in
light of the short—run dangers of switching to the use of organophosphates without providing training. n35

n35 Registrants adduced considerable testimony on the effects of organophosphates on non-target species.
Sevin, it appears, is highly toxic to bees and most witnesses agreed that the organophosphates were toxic to non-
target animals, usually birds and insect life, present when a field is sprayed. The present evidence demonstrates,
however, that these organophosphate compounds are less "persistent," and thus do not leach or erode into waters
or collect in the human food chain. While it may be that in time the familiar phrase "familiarity breeds
contempt“ will apply, as we learn more about these compounds, they appear not to present a longrange hazard
to man or aquatic areas. Where registrants have scored, is by demonstrating the acute toxicity of methyl
parathion which is the primary alternative chemical for many of the crop uses in question. That fact does not,
however, alter the long—term balance between the risks and benefits, in View of the non-persistence of the
organophosphates.

C. APPLICATION OF RISK—BENEFIT T0 NON-CROP USES
There remains the question of the disposition on the registered health and government uses and other non~crop uses of
DDT. It should be emphasized that these hearings have never involved the use of DDT by other nations in their health
control programs. As we said in our DDT Statement of March, 1971, "this Agency will not presume to regulate the
felt necessities of other countries." Statement, at 8. Indeed, the FlFRA does not apply to exports. Section 7, 7 USE. §
135 (1972).

Given the alternatives for mothproofing and control of bats and mice-proprietary governmental uses of DDT—I am
persuaded that the benefits are even more de minimal than the risks. On the other hand, public health and quarantine
programs fall into a wholly separate category. See EDF v. Ruckelshaus, 439 F.2d at 594; DDT Statement of Reasons
at ll.

While alternatives also exist for use in public health-quarantine programs and, in most instances, DDT is no longer the
yeoman chemical, I believe that it would be unwise to restrict knowledgeable public officials to the choice of one or
[*41] two chemicals. Like a physician, the public official must have an ample arsenal for the combat of disease and
infestation.

I cannot, however, be indifferent to the fact that the record suggests that "health and quarantine" uses have, in the past,
apparently included proprietary uses by government, Nor can I be complacent about non-supervised use for these
purposes by private citizens. I am, accordingly, requiring a label which will restrain indiscriminate use of DDT for a
wide variety of purposes under the rubric of official use. That label language is set forth in the order accompanying
this opinion, and is designed to restrict shipment of DDT only to U.S. Government officials and State Health
Departments who will be knowledgeable as to the most effective means for control and mindful of the risks of using
DDT. Thus, on an application-by-application basis for necessary health and quarantine purposes, the benefits will be
maximized and outweigh the risks. n36 Cf. 42 U.S.C. § 4332 (1971) which requires an environmental impact
statement on ongoing official programs.

n36 The use of DDT in Topocide, a prescription drug, is regulated by both the Food and Drug Administration
and this Agency. The alternative, Kwell, is a lindane product. I am, however, taking judicial notice of the fact
that lindane registrations are presently under review by this Agency's Pesticides Office and several uses of
lindane have, in the past, been the subject of cancellation proceedings. See In Re Hari Kari Lindane, supra. I am
not prepared to judge on this record whether or not the risk to the environment and the public at large from DDT
shampoo is greater than from lindane shampoo. As for the direct effects on the user of the drug, this matter is for
FDA and the prescribing physician.

[‘42]
V

I turn now to the disposition of these dockets in light of the foregoing principles. At the outset it should be noted that
recent judicial decisions have urged this Agency to use its “flexibility, in both final decisions and suspension orders,
to differentiate between uses of the product" (SeeEDF v. EPA (opinion of Judge Leventhal), supra: at 20), and
reminded us that creative adaptability is the keystone of a workable regulatory process. Cf SEC v. National
Securities, Inc, 393 U.S. 453, 463 (l969). EDT v. EPA, while discussing suspension, serves as a beacon in this
regard, suggesting that registrations be continued selectively, taking into account "restrictions on kinds and extent of
use." Id. at 23. Bearing these principles in mind, I turn first to the form and shape our orders should take.

A. Disposition as to Onions, Stored Sweet Potatoes and Sweet Peppers

There is evidence that DDT is the only useful chemical for controlling heavy corn borer infestations which attack
green peppers in the Del Marva Peninsula. The record shows that about 13,500 pounds of DDT are used regularly as a
ground application for [*43] prophylactic purposes. Sevin, guthion, and phospharnidon can, however, be used at less
than 30% infestation. Del Marva produces less than 5% of the nation's sweet peppers and other crops can be profitably
produced. The Agency staff has conceded in its April 15 brief in support of proposed findings, conclusions and order
that this use of DDT "comes closest—~of all the uses in issue--to being necessary in the sense that no real alternative
insect control method exists under certain conditions." (Brief, at 93 .)

The evidence concerning use of DDT to control cutworms is less clear-cut. Apparently cutworm infestations in the
northwest are sporadic and localized. While it would appear that other chemicals could be used to control cutworm
infestations on onions as with peanuts, none are apparently registered. No party has cited evidence of record showing
what percent of the onion-producing acreage would be affected by a cancellation of DDT.

The evidence with respect to use of DDT as a "dip" to protect stored sweet potatoes against weevil infestation is even
spottier. Neither counsel for the parties not our research has pointed us to evidence of record showing the precise
volume of DDT [*44] use for this purpose, its likely effect on the environment, or the degree of loss that might be

Page 72

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, ‘; 1 BAD. 9
sustained by producers.
While it would be far easier simply to cancel or not cancel the registrations for these uses, I believe that
environmental problems should be parsed with a scalpel, not a hacksaw. While EDF and my own state‘s urge
cancellation, on the ground that producers can easily shit? to producing different crops, there is no evidence as to how
long such transition might require. Moreover, it may be that continued use of a limited volume of DDT in these few
areas, taken in conjunction with aggregate volume of use for other purposes, like health, present no risk to the
environment. Obviously much of the stress on the "global" environment is reduced by curtailing overall volume of
usage and we must then estimate the impact of use, both on the environment as a whole, and the local surroundings.
Lastly, it may well be relevant to examine the impact on overall supply of a commodity. Even though peppers, onions
and sweet potatoes may not be food "staples," it may be that the other acreage is not suited for producing these crops.
In that event, it will be necessary to determine whether [‘45] or not supplies will satisfy demand, and whether or not
a transition period should be fixed to permit a market adjustment. n37

n37 It is a recognized policy of common law nuisance and also of federal environmental legislation to afford
affected producers a transitional period for implementing new requirements.

It follows that additional evidence is required to determine the answers to these questions. In the interim the
cancellation orders will remain in effect, subject to registrants or users petitioning to present additional evidence. In
that event, a stay order will issue pending the determination on remand. If these users or registrants can demonstrate
that a produce shortage will result and their particular use of DDT, taken with other uses, does not create undue stress
on the general or local environment, particularly the aquasphere, cancellation should be lifted. If no produce shortage
will result because other acreage is suitable for these crops, it shall still be open to demonstrate that a transitional
period [‘46] is required for switching to new crops. If the interim use of DDT does not constitute an environmental
risk, final orders of cancellation for these uses will be deferred until the transition can be accomplished, provided
assurances are received at the hearing that formulators and users will not permit bootlegging.

B. The Switch to Methyl Farathion

The need for a transition period arises also in connection with those uses that are being canceled based on the
existence of methyl parathion.

The record before me leaves no doubt that the chief substitute for most uses of DDT, methyl parathion, is highly toxic
chemical and, if misused, is dangerous to applicators. n38 This was the virtually unanimous opinion of all the
witnesses. The introduction into use of organophosphates has, in the past, caused deaths among users who are
untrained in their application and the testimony and exhibits of record point to the unhappy experience of several
years ago where four deaths occurred at the time ethyl parathion began to be used on tobacco crops. Other testimony
noted the increase in nonfatal accidents and attributed almost one»half reported pesticide poisonings to the
organophosphate group. [*47] A survey conducted alter the organophosphates began to replace chlorinated
hydrocarbons in Texas suggests a significantly increased incidence of poisonings.

n38 Not all of the possible substitutes for DDT are equally potent. For example, trichlorofon, monocrotophos,
malathion and carbaryl, among others, are available to control many cotton pests; carbaryl is an all-purpose
chemical for most cotton pests. It is, however, abundantly clear that methyl parathion will be widely used.

That the skilled and trained user may apply organophosphates with complete safety is of comfort only if there is an
orderly transition from DDT to methyl parathion so as to train workers now untutored in the ways of proper use.

I am accordingly making this order effective as of December 31, 1972, insofar as the cancellations of any particular
use is predicated on the availability of methyl parathion as a substitute. In the months that follow the Department of
Agriculture and state extension services and representatives of EPA will have time [*48] to begin educating those
workers who will have to use methyl parathion in future growing seasons. Such a program can also introduce farmers
to the less acutely toxic organophosphates, like carbaryl, which may be satisfactory for many uses.

VI

Far from being inconsistent with the general congressional mandate of F IFRA, a period of adjustment to train users of
methyl parathion or permit a needed transition where no substitutes exist is a logical outgrowth of a sensible
application of risk~benefit analysis. While the legislative history does not address the specific problem before me—-the
tinting of cancellation orders the hearings that preceded the enactment of fiFRA indicate that congressional concern
for safety of the farmer-user of pesticides was no less than Congress’ solicitude for the environment. While Congress
ultimately struck a balance that generally places the risk of negligence on the applicator, see Stearns v. EPA, supra, it
did so in light of assurances that farmers are for their own safety as well as that of the environment being trained in
proper methods of application. See Hearings before the Subcommittee on Departmental Oversight and Consumer

Page 73

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; 1 E.A.D. 9
Relations [‘49] of the House Committee on Agriculture, supra, at 54, 68. n39

n39 At least two courts have given express recognition to the similarity between the regulatory schemes in
HERA and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: See Welfimi v. Ruckelshaus, 439 F.2d 598 (DC. Cir. 1971); Nor—
Am V. Hardin, 435 F.2d 1133 (7th Cir. 1970) (en band). I believe that the trail Congress intended me to follow is
marked by its directive in Section 348 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 348(f)(3) (1971),
which permits the Secretary to set an effective date for his orders. While similar language has not been expressly
included in fiFRA, its omission can hardly be considered advertant in View of the legislative history. See S.
Rept. No. 573 (881th Cong, 1st Sess. 1963); H. Rept. No. 1125 (88th Cong, 2d Sess. 1964). The purpose of the
1964 amendments was to eliminate registration under protest.

The risk-benefit equation [‘50] is a dynamic one. Timing is a variable in that equation. What may, in the long run, be
necessary to protect the environment could be a short-term threat to human health. This is exactly the case before me
now. The benefits of using organophosphates are a long-range benefit and the risks of DDT result from continued
long. term use. In the very short run, however, the equation balances out very differently. n40 Likewise, the prospect
of dislocation which might ensue were the use of DDT immediately halted where no alternatives exist is a factor we
must reckon with. The major environmental regulatory statutes, enacted and pending, provide "lead time" for an
adjustment to new requirements. n41

n40 I do not believe that the Seventh Circuit's decision in Steam: Phosphorous Paste Co. v. EPA, supra,
precludes me from taking into account the short-term dangers that could result from increased use of methyl
parathion by untrained users. Steam: holds that a product is not "misbranded" simply because it can be highly
dangerous if the user is careless. This reasoning does not, however, compel me to ignore the tendency of human
beings to be negligent where we are dealing with the implementation of an order that will increase use of a
highly dangerous substance Even negligence can be minimized by training. [*51]

n41 While the Examiner excluded from evidence a study of the DDT problem for this Agency undertaken by a
Committee of the National Academy of Sciences, it is appropriate to note that Committee recommended a
phase-out period for the same reasons outlined in this opinion. While I reach my conclusions without relying on
that report's factual findings and recommendations, and base them on the record as compiled below, I believe the
report was erroneously excluded from the record, particularly in view of the offer by counsel for the Agency to
produce a committee member for cross-examination.

While impatience is understandable in view of the past history of delay, we must not be lulled into the belief that
long-standing problems can be corrected by overnight solutions. Today's decision provides a definitive answer to the
status of DDT registrations and all concerned: to this Agency, farmers, manufacturers, the Department of Agriculture,
and extension services; all must proceed with alacrity toward the implementation of this order.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

l. DDT formulations when labeled with directions for use in the production of those crops named in finding (I) G and
for use on bats, mice and fabric are "misbranded," within the meaning of Sections 2(z)(2) (c), (d) and (e) of fiFRA, 7
U.S.C. § 135.

2. DDT when labeled with directions "for use by and distribution to only U.S. Public Health Service officials or for
distribution by or on approval by the U.S. Public Health Service to other health service officials for control of vector
diseases, for use by and distribution to the Public Health Service, USDA, and military for quarantine use; for use in
prescription drugs to be dispensed only on [‘59] authorization by a certified medical doctor" along with the caution
printed in bold type "use for any purpose not specified or not in accordance with directions and use by unauthorized

ORDER

In accordance with the foregoing opinion, findings and conclusions of law, use of DDT on cotton, beans (snap, lima,
and dry), peanuts, cabbage, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, tomatoes, fresh market corn, garlic, pimientoes, in
commercial greenhouses, for mothproofing and control of bats and rodents are hereby canceled as of December 31,
1972.

Use of DDT for control of weevils on stored sweet potatoes, green peppers in the De] Marva Peninsula and cutworms
on onions are canceled unless within 30 days users or registrants move to supplement the record in accordance with
Part V of my opinion of today. In such event the order shall be stayed, pending the completion of the record, on terms
and conditions set by the Hearing Examiner, provided that this stay may be dissolved if interested users or registrants
do not present the required evidence in an expeditious fashion. At the conclusion [‘60] of such proceedings, the issue
of cancellation shall be resolved in accordance with my opinion today.
Cancellation for uses of DDT by public health officials in disease control programs and by USDA and the military for
health quarantine and use in prescription drugs is lifted.
In order to implement this decision no DDT shall be shipped in interstate commerce or within the District of
Columbia or any American territory after December 31, 1972, unless its label bears in a prominent fashion in bold
type and capital letters, in a manner satisfactory to the Pesticides Regulation Division, the following language:

(I) FOR USE BY AND DISTRIBUTION TO ONLY U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE OFfiCIALS
OR FOR DISTRIBUTION BY OR ON APPROVAL BY THE U .8. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE TO
OTHER HEALTH SERVICE OFfiCIALS FOR CONTROL OF VECTOR DISEASES; (2) FOR USE
BY AND DISTRIBUTION TO THE USDA OR MILITARY FOR HEALTH QUARANTINE USE; (3)
FOR USE IN THE FORMULATION FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR CONTROLLING BODY
LICE; (4) OR IN DRUG; FOR USE IN CONTROLLING BODY LICE—-TO BE DISPENSED ONLY
BY PHYSICIANS.

USE BY OR DISTRIBUTION TO UNAUTHORIZED USERS OR USE FOR A PURPOSE NOT

SPECIFIED HEREON OR NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH [*61] DIRECTIONS IS DISAPPROVED

BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT: THIS SUBSTANCE IS HARMFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
The Pesticides Regulation Division may require such other language as it considers appropriate.
This label may be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions for shipment for use on green peppers in Del Marva,
cutworms on onions, and weevils on stored sweet potatoes if a stay is in effect.

sought cancellation of DDT registrations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (fiFRA) in October 19
FN3 More than a year later, and after two cases challenging the lack of Government action had been brought in and decided by r
court, IFN41 on 15 January 1971 ENS the Administrator of EPA issued cancellation notices for all registrations of insecticide
containing DDT. However, no suspension of use was required at this time.

Environmental Pesticide Control Act of 1972, which requires denial of registration unless the substance 'will perform its intent.

commonly recognized pracfice it will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.’ [F‘N19l The FIFRA

FNZO, 7 U.SlC. § 135b(c) 0970),

The Administrator's Order is challenged on two grounds: (1) is it based on substantial evidence in the record; (2) does it comply V
the requirements of the National Environnnental Policy Act (NEPA)? For the reasons explicated in Parts 11 and {11 below, to l
questions our answer is affirmative. ll. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATOR’S ORDER

A. The Test

Explicitly established in the substantive legislation are the standards for judicial review. Once the Administrator has made a f:
order concerning the registration of a pesticide, that order is appealable to the United States Court of Appeals. The fiFRA star
directs the Court of Appeals to sustain the findings *1251 "127 of the Administrator with respect to questions of fact if supported
substantial evidence when considered on the record as a whole.’ FN21[ The 1972 amendments further elaborate the scope of judi
review;

FN21.7 U.S.C. § 135b(d) (1970).

The court shall consider all evidence of record. The order of the Administrator shall be sustained if it is supported by substantial
evidence when considered on the record as a whole. [FN22]

FN22. 7 U.S.C. § 136nm (Supp. 11, 1972).

The two versions provide standards of review which are somewhat different, in that the court under the 1970 language need 0
support findings of fact by the Administrator if based on substantial evidence, but the 1972 language requires the court to sup}
orders of the Administrator which are based on substantial evidence. The 1972 amendment was enacted and effective on 21 Oct.
1972, four months after the Administrator issued his Order in question here, but well before our judicial review While the par
seem to assume that the 1970 version is controlling for purposes of our review, [W231 the 1972 statute has no provision denying
application to judicial review of prior orders of the Administrator. We read the 1972 amendment as establishing a standard effect
for judicial review commencing after 21 October 1972, and therefore applicable in the case at bar.

FN23. Brief of Petitioner, Coahoma Chemical Co, at 15; Brief of Petitioner, EDF, at 32.

[1][2] In any event, the provisions for judicial review under both the 1970 and 1972 language clearly require the court to determine
whether the findings of fact of the Administrator are based upon substantial evidence when considered on the record as a whole. Thus
we must apply a traditional type of substantial evidence test, albeit one based on an extraordinarily voluminous record. [FN24]
'Substantial evidence' was long ago defined by Chief Justice Hughes as 'more than a mere scintilla, It means such relevant evidence

a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.‘ Consolidated Edison Co v, NLRB. |FN25l And since the state
requires the whole record to be considered as in Universal Camera Corp, v. NLRB:

The substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight . . . . (This docs not mean
that even as to matters not requiring expertise a court may displace the Board's choice between two fairly conﬂicting views, 0|

The Supreme Court has more recently recognized in Console v. Federal Maritime Comission that there may be inconsist
conclusions which can be drawn from the same record, each of which may be supported by substantial evidence. Thus, ‘substan
evidence’

is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence (it
not prevent an administrative agency's finding fiom being supported by substantial evidence. FN27l

FN27. 383 U.S. 607 620 86 S.Ct. 1018, 1027, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 {1966}

 

The Supreme Court went on to point out that the substantial evidence test 'frecs the reviewing courts of the time-consuming a
difficult task of weighing the evidence, it gives proper respect to the expertise of the administrative tribunal and it helps promote
uniform *1252 “128 application of the statute.‘ F N281 Other courts have stressed that where questions involve a special expertise
an agency, such as in detailed scientific proceedings, the agency deserves special deference from the courts, although careful revicn
of course always required. [FN28]

FN28. Ibid.

 

In the case at bar our task is made somewhat simpler than the agency's by adhering conscientiously to the proper scope ofjudic
review of administrative action, i.e,, we as a court are confronted with a problem in administrative law, not in chemistry, biolog
medicine, or ecology. It is the administrative agency which has been called upon to hear and evaluate testimony in all scientific ficl
relevant to its ultimate question of permission or prohibition of the sale and use of DDT. The EPA Administrator had an oppomm
to make a careful study of the record of seven months of public hearings and the summaries of evidence prepared for himnj
heard oral argument, and now has arrived at a decision to ban most uses of DDT. It is his decision which we must review; we are r
to make the same decision ourselves We are concerned with how he did it and on how much evidence, Since there is no challenge
procedure here, our problem narrows down to whether his decision is supported by substantial evidence based on the record as
whole

B. The Evidence

Copr. @ West 2004 No Claim to Orig. US Govt, Works

Page 83

A review of the evidence in this case, as summarized by all the briefs, indicates that the situation is as described in Consolo: there
great mass of often inconsistent evidence which was developed at the hearing; this evidence is substantial enOUgh to support
conclusions of the Administrator, although it possibly might support contrary conclusions as well. Considering the evidence in
record as a whole, we cannot say that the Administrator’s decision was not based on substantial evidence, even if the hazardous mat
of DDT ha not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt Sufficient evidence has been adduced to show potentially great dangers fr
DDT, and the Administrator’s decision to cancel the DDT registrations is well within his statutory authority.

Specifically, the Administrator states that DDT is hazardous because of several of its inherent properties: its persistence, mobil
and lipid solubility. IFNSII He contends that the alternatives to DDT do not have such properties, although he concedes that
alternatives may be more acutely toxic in the short run. He presents detailed evidence concerning the human hazards which may ar
from DDT (carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of DDT), and also details the environmental hazards (effects on phytoplanki
beneficial agricultural insects, aquatic invertebrates, fish, and birds). FNJZ! He concludes that an unacceptable risk to man and
environment is posed by continued use of DDT, IFN33[ aside from the few carefully conh’olled uses concerning public health 2
agricultural quarantine purposes, which he permits. ENS-t

These findings and the evidence on which they are based are vigorously challenged by Coahoma and other DDT users. While tr

evidence might be sufficient to have allowed the Administrator to have decided the other way, and permit DDT to continue, th
evidence *1253 "129 is not sufficient to vitiate the actual decision of the Administrator as not having been based on substan
evidence in the record as a whole.

L11 Since the Administrator here decided contrary to the conclusions of the Hearing Examiner, the question arises concerning

proper deference to be given to the Hearing Examiner‘s report. As the Supreme Court indicated in Universal Camera, the bear
examiner's findings and opinion are to be considered as part of the evidence of record, both by the administrator and by the review
court.

We do not require that the examiner‘s findings be given more weight than in reason and in the light of judicial eXperience ti
deserve. The 'substantial evidence' standard is not modified in any way when the Board and its examiner disagree. We intend only
recognize that evidence supporn‘ng a conclusion may be less substantial when an impartial, experienced examiner who has obsen
the wimesses'and lived with the case has drawn conclusions different from the Board's than when he has reached the same conclusi
. . .. The significance of his report, of course, depends largely on the importance of credibility in the particular case. FNSS

Later, in FCC v. Allentown Broadcasting Corp. lFN361 the Court indicated that where responsibility for decision was placed on
Board, it would be inconsistent to require the Board to adopt an examiner's findings unless rejection would be ‘clearly erroneoi
However, the Court did not elaborate on the proper standard to be applied. Subsequently in an opinion by Judge Tamm in Cinderc

Bl Applying the law to the facts at hand, we conclude that the Adrninish'ator has given sufficient weight to the hearing examirt
report. The Administrator reviewed the report of the examiner and the exceptions to the report filed by the EPA staff. He decided
case on the basis of the record developed at the hearings, additional briefs, oral argument, and specially prepared summaries. Jljfi
The case appears to be one where the demeanor of witnesses is not particularly important, and where the examiner himself had
particular expertise, for he was a coal mine accident specialist. F.\ 39} The Administrator could derive a proper appreciation of
effect of cross examination in the case by a reading of the record. Thus we conclude that sufficient weight was given to
examiner's report.

FN38r See note 30, supra.
FN39. Brief of Respondent, Ruckelshaus, at 16.

In another aspect of the question of the substantiality of the evidence, Coahoma, et al., urge that the Administrators findings
insufficient in that they are based to a large extent on data which does not directly and specifically relate to the use of DDT to con
the boll weevil and the bollworm in the cotton growing areas of the Southeast. [FN40 it is true that much of the evidence in
record concerning dangers of DDT *1254 “130 does not specifically relate to this one area or to the use on cotton crops. Ilowev:
is not necessary to have evidence on such a specific use or area in order to be able to conclude on the basis of substantial evidence
the use of DDT in genEIal in hazardous. The Administrator has pointed to evidence in the record showing that use of DDT exce}:
minuscule amounts in highly controlled circumstances should be curtailed because of unreasonable risks to health and
environment. iFNdll Reliance on general data, consideration of laboratory experiments on animals, etcr, provide a sufficient basi
support the Administrator's findings, even with regard to each special use of DDT.

FNdO. It appears that most of the DDT now in use in the United States is for control of cotton pests, primarily the bollwc
In fact, at least 70% of all DDT is used in the cotton-growing areas, especially the Southeast. Brief of Respond

uses in l969~1971.

F N41. See notes 32—34, supra, For the EPA's argument directed towards cotton pests, see Brief of Respondent, Ruckelsh
at 86-99.

On the other hand, EDF challenges the Administrator's decision to allow use of DDT in controlling certain public health problem
in agricultural quarantines antines as not being based on substantial evidence. Specifically EDF contends that there is no nee-i
retain these uses of DDT, and that the usual dangers of DDT are present in these particular uses. |EN421 The Administrator finds
these uses may be necessary to combat potential, severe public health problems, and so DDT registrations for these purposes shc
be allowed. The necessity arises from the fact that alternative pesticides are also under EPA review, that situations may arise wl:
the alternatives are not effective, iFN-Ql and that DDT must be available. Because the allowance of continued registration does
mean condoned use, except where certified to be necessary, the Administrator concludes that the benefits of continued registrai
outweigh the risks inherent in such a minuscule use. This View has support in the record as a whole, and thus satisfies the substan
evidence test.

FN42. Brief of Petitioner, EDF, at 91-92.
FNA3. Brief of Respondent, Ruckelshaus, at 106-107.

[£1 The entire Order of the Administrator is supported by substantial evidence when the record as a whole is considered. Unds
proper application of the substantial evidence test, as formulated by the Supreme Court and by this Circuit, we affirm

Administrator's Order. We stress again that from an administrative law perspective we simply conclude that the Administrator's Or
is adequately supported by evidence in the record. We do not decide whether we, ourselves, would ban DDT, nor should W6

decide. We have, however, carefully reviewed the decision of the Administrator, and conclude that it should be affirmed.
lll. COMPLIANCE WITH THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT OF 1969

The second challenge to the EPA's action raised by petitioners Coahoma Chemical Co., et al, concerns the failure of EPA to ti
specific report under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). That statute requires that

to the fullest extent possible . , . all agencies of the Federal Government shall , . . include in every recommendation or report
proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human Environment, 3 detai
statement by the responsible official on-- (i) the environmental impact of the proposed action . . ., [FN44l *1255 “131 This has t
interpreted to require an agency to prepare an environmental impact statement whenever the agency's proposed action will hav
significant effect on the environment.

FN-Mt 42 U.S.C. § 433212)}C) (1970),. The statement is required to include consideration of

(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action,

(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,

(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,

(iv) the relationship between local short‘term uses of man‘s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long—ta
productivity, and

(v) any irreversible and irretn'cvable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it
implemented.

Id.

There is little doubt but that the action of EPA in withdrawing DDT registrations will have a substantial effect on the hurt
environment-a indeed, that was the very purpose of the EPA action. The court is asked to consider two other, somewhat interrela
questions concerning NEPA. first, is the EPA an agency subject to the requirements of the statute when it undertakes environmei
actions such as the cancellation of DDT registrations here? Second, has EPA in effect complied with the requirements, despite the l
of a formal NEPA impact statement?

Petitioners Coahoma Chemical Co,, et al., urge that EPA is not exempted from the NEPA requirements. They stress the statut
language requiring ALL agencies to comply, and note that there is no specific language in either NEPA or fiFRA which exem
EPA in this or any other set of circumstances. They note two District Court cases which indicate that all agencies, even
environmental ones, are covered by the NEPA requirements. FN45 Furthermore, they contrast the action of Congress in providin
specific exemption for EPA in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, FN46] with the absence of a provis
in the 1972 fiFRA amendments enacted three days later. [FN471

FN45. The two cases noted by Coahoma are Kahir v. Resor, 335 F.5upp. I (12.11.019711 (re Corps of Engineers),
Anaconda v. Ruckelslmus, 352 F.5upp. 697 {n.ColoJWZ! (re EPA). The first of these cases was dismissed as moot

L71 We conclude that where an agency is engaged primarily in an examination of environmental questions, where substantive z
procedural standards ensure hill and adequate consideration of environmentalissucs, then formal compliance with NEPA is
necessary, but fimctional compliance is sufficient. We are not formulating a broad exemption from NEPA for all environmci
agencies or even for all environmentally protective regulatory actions of such agencies. Instead, we delineate a narrow exempt
from the literal requirements for those actions which are undertaken pursuant to sufficient safeguards so that the purpose and polic
behind NEPA will necessarily be fiilfilled, The EPA action here meets this standard, and hence this challenge to the EPA actioi
rejected.

IV. CONCLUSION

On review of the decision and Order of the EPA Administrator, we find it to be supported by substantial evidence based on the rec
as a whole, Furthemiore, we find that EPA has provided the functional equivalent of a formal NEPA report. Therefore, the I
challenges raised concerning the Administrator's decision to cancel DDT registrations are rejected and the Administrator's actior
affirmed.
