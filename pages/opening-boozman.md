## OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BOOZMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS 

Senator BOOZMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
It is good to see the miners here. It is important that you are 
here. 

One topic we are hearing a lot about today is the 97 percent con-
sensus among scientists on climate change. It is important to ask, 
where does this 97 percent number come from and what does it 
mean? 

Many scientists question the level of certainty behind the specific 
climate change scenarios. Others have shown gaps in our knowl-
edge of climate sensitivity. Others have raised questions regarding 
the reliability of climate models and yet scientists who raise any 
of these issues can still be counted as the 97 percent. 
Too often anybody who raises a question or disagrees with the 
left wing political position is called out as opposing views held by 
97 percent of the published climate scientists as we are hearing 
today. 

This is clearly not true. Again, what does this number mean? 
The statistic comes from a 2013 review of scientific literature pub-
lished between 1991 and 2011. This review found that among ab-
stracts expressing a position on anthropogenic global warming, 97.1 
percent endorsed the consensus position that humans were causing 
global warming. 

Basically, if anyone agrees with human activity’s influence on the 
climate, that is a pretty broad definition. 
Policymakers who disagree with the expensive big government 
left wing climate policies might still actually agree with the 97 per-
cent consensus. Scientists who question important elements of cur-
rent climate scientists are included in the number. 
For example, last year, this committee received testimony from 
the climatologist Dr. Roy Spencer. To give you an idea of where he 
stands, Dr. Spencer published a book entitled, ‘‘The Great Global 
Warming Blunder, How Global Warming Hysteria Leads to Bad 
Science, Pandering Politicians and Misguided Policies that Hurt 
the Poor.’’ 

Given his outspoken position on climate policy, Dr. Spencer’s 
comments on the 97 percent statistics are noteworthy. He testified 
‘‘The fact that I believe at least some of recent warming is human 
caused makes me in the 97 percent of researchers who recently 
claimed to support the global warming consensus. The 97 percent 
statement therefore is innocuous since it probably includes all of 
the global skeptics I know who are actively working in the field.’’ 
In short, like the offensive term deniers, the 97 percent statistic 
is a misleading tactic used to marginalize people who are concerned 
about hardworking Americans and impose an all pain, no gain en-
ergy policy that is bad for our Country and will not change the 
global climate. 

I am not a scientist but I am an optometrist. I spent much of my 
life working with the scientific community. I was a zoology major. 
I have said before that there is nothing scientific about discrediting 
people who present conflicting evidence and ask reasonable ques-
tions.

Politicians aren’t science referees cutting off debate when it suits 
one side and no one has a monopoly on the facts. The bottom line 
is we must ask whether these Obama administration policies are 
worth the lost jobs, lower take home pay, higher gas and electricity 
prices, higher food prices and so on. 

The President once said that his climate policies would make the 
cost of electricity necessarily skyrocket and I believe him. Let us 
remember that the pain will last for decades and falls hardest on 
low income families. We are driving our industries overseas, hurt-
ing American workers and creating foreign factories that emit far 
more than we would. 

I believe in American leadership but we are fooling ourselves if 
we believe that China, Russia, India, Vietnam and so forth are 
going to follow the President’s lead and shut down their power 
plants. 

With that said, I thank our witnesses for being here and look for-
ward to your testimony. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Boozman. 
I will now turn to Senator Gillibrand.
