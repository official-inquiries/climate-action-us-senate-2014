Kochs launch new super PAC for midterm fight

During a closed-door gathering of major donors in Southern California on Monday. the
political operation spearheaded by the Koch brothers unveiled a significant new weapon in
its rapidly expanding arsenal — a super PAC called Freedom Partners Action Fund.

The new group aims to spend more than $15 million in the 2014 midterm campaigns — part
of a much larger spending effort expected to total $290 million, sources told POLITICO,

It’s an evolution for billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch. The vast network of
political nonprofit groups they helped build has mostly funneled its unprecedented political
spending into issue-based campaigns that usually slam Democrats for supporting big
government but seldom explicitly ask voters to support GOP candidates.

That‘s expected to change under Freedom Partners Action F und, according to Marc Short,
president of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, an increasingly powerful force in the
Koch network that will operate in association with the new super PAC.

“The Freedom Partners Action Fund will support candidates who share our vision of free
markets and a free society and oppose candidates who support intrusive government
policies that push the American Dream out of reach for the American people," Short told
POLITICO after a presentation to donors at the St. Regis Monarch Beach resort in Dana
Point, California.

The gathering is the latest in a series of twice-annual so-called seminars that the Kochs started
holding in 2003 to raise cash from wealthy donors after treating them to a series of slickly
produced presentations from handpicked politicians, conservative media stars and
operatives from Koch-backed groups.

Freedom Partners, which was created in 2011. now organizes and hosts the seminars. The
theme of the St. Regis seminar— “American Courage; Our commitment to a free society‘ -
was printed on massive posters evoking an idyllic turn—of-the-century immigration motif. The
posters, which depicted an immigrant family gazing in awe at the Statue of Liberty in the
distance, were displayed throughout the St. Regis. A photo of one was provided upon
request to POLITICO by Freedom Partners spokesman James Davis, who explained that the
purpose of the seminar was “continued discussions about advancing a free society with the
theme of American Courage."

Among the dignitaries who was scheduled to address the crowd was Sen. Marco Rubio (R-
Fla.), whose office declined to comment on his appearance, It was initially reported by the Daily
Beast, which also first reported the $290 million overall Spending goal.

Democrats are sure to seize on the new Freedom Partners super PAC as yet more fodder in
their mounting campaign to caricature the brothers as evil puppeteers manipulating Republicans.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent a fundraising missive Sunday
declaring the Daily Beast’s report “AWFUL NEWS" and pleading "if we can't start closing this
gap TODAY, the Koch brothers WlLt. buy the election for John Boehner and the GOP.”

A spokesman for Koch industries, the Koch brothers’ privately held industrial conglomerate,
referred all questions to Freedom Partners. A Koch industries website entry posted before
Freedom Partners took over responsibility for the seminars describes them as an opportunity
for “America‘s greatest philanthropists and most successful business leaders" to ”discuss
solutions to our most pressing issues and strategies to promote policies that will help grow
our economy, foster free enterprise and create American jobs."

The events are typically held under extremely tight security and attendees are warned not to
divulge the proceedings. They typically conclude with pledge sessions that have almost a
revival-type feel where it‘s not unusual for donors to promise six— and seven-figure checks into
the political cash pool that is now administered by Freedom Partners. Since most of the
groups in the network don’t disclose individual donations, the names of the donors are often
kept secret

The new super PAC, by contrast, will be obligated to disclose its donors, which makes it
unique in Koch World and seems to be part of a move by Freedom Partners to introduce
some transparency into the network's activities.

Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, unlike the super PAC, is registered as a 501(c)6
trade association, a section of the Tax Code that allows groups to shield donors’ names. it
initially acted as something of a bank for the Koch network, mostly writing grants to other groups
to air ads or mobilize activists around small—government, free—market issues, But Freedom
Partners, which doled out $236 million in grants in 2012, is playing an increasingly larger role,
including airing its own ads, as the Koch network moves to centralize its political operations.

During breakout sessions Sunday at the St. Regis, Freedom Partners research director
Karen Steward joined veteran Koch aide Nancy Pfotenhauer, now a senior adviser to the
group, to talk about its expanded spending on energy-related issues, which is expected to
include more than $13 million in spending ahead of the midterms.

The energy initiative is seen by Koch Kremlinologists as emblematic of Freedom Partners‘
growth. Whereas in 2012, the group donated $1.5 million to American Energy Alliance, a
nonprofit group that aired $3.6 million of ads attacking President Barack Obama over rising gas
prices, now Freedom Partners is increasingly also taking on such campaigns itself.

AEA president Tom Pyle welcomed Freedom Partners' expanded footprint, which he cast as
important in winning an increasingly contentious debate around energy issues and greenhouse
gas emissions that has drawn big—spending by deep—pocketed environmental groups and liberal
donors. The retired San Francisco hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer is planning to
underwrite a $100-million campaign to elect candidates who support aggressive efforts to

combat climate change. Steyer has sought cash for his political effort from rich donors who
attend secretive gatherings of the liberal Democracy Alliance club, which bears some similarities to
the Koch network and its meetings,

“The fact that the Freedom Partners network has recognized this and is throwing their hat into
the ring on energy and environmental issues is welcoming news," said Pyle. “We’re pleased
that they are joining the fight to promote free market energy policies that will improve the lives
of millions of Americans."

The Koch network raised $70 million at its first donor seminar of the 2014 election cycle in
April 2013, as revealed in the new book, "Big Money: 2.5 Billion Dollars, One suspicious Vehicle, and a
Pimp— on the Trail of the Ultra-Rich Hijacking American Politics." And the Daily Beast reported that the
network collected nearly $170 million in pledges at its January seminar, making $290 million
a seemingly attainable goal.

The projected tally underscores the migration of power and money away from the political
party committees to major donors and outside groups, generally, and the Koch network
specifically. in 2012, the biggest spending party congressional campaign arm - Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee —— spent only $183 million.
