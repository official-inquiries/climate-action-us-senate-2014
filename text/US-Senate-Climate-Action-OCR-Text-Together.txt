CLIMATE CHANGE: THE NEED TO ACT NOW 

Wednesday, June 18, 2014 

U.S. SENATE, 
COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS, 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON CLEAN AIR AND NUCLEAR SAFETY, 
Washington, DC. 
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. in room 
406, Dirksen Senate Building, Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse (chairman 
of the subcommittee) presiding. 
Present: Senators Whitehouse, Cardin, Sanders, Markey, 
Gillibrand, Booker, Sessions, Barrasso, Crapo, Boozman, Inhofe 
and Vitter. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. The hearing of the EPW Subcommittee on 
Clean Air and Nuclear Safety will come to order. 
We will have opening statements from the members limited to 5 
minutes each followed by introduction and swearing of the wit-
nesses, followed by the testimony of the witnesses. I know that 
Ranking Member Sessions will be joining us later. I would like to 
thank him and members of the subcommittee and our witnesses for 
being here today to discuss the need to act on carbon pollution and 
climate change. 

We are privileged to have before our subcommittee four former 
Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency. All of 
them solved contentious environmental problems during their ten-
ures working for Republican presidents. Now they are banding to-
gether to bring attention to the biggest environmental threat of all, 
climate change. 

In a New York Times op-ed written last year, that I would like 
to enter into the record, without objection, these former Adminis-
trators stated, ‘‘We have a message that transcends political affili-
ation. The United States must move now on substantive steps to 
curb climate change at home and internationally.’’

A Republican Case for Climate Action

By WILLIAM D. RUCKELSHAUS LEE M. THOMAS, WILLIAM K. REILLY and CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN

EACH of us took turns over the past 43 years running the Environmental Protection Agency. We served Republican presidents, but we have a message that transcends political affiliation: the United States must move now on substantive steps to curb climate change, at home and internationally.

There is no longer any credible scientific debate about the basic facts: our world continues to warm, with the last decade the hottest in modern records, and the deep ocean warming faster than the earth’s atmosphere. Sea level is rising. Arctic Sea ice is melting years faster than projected.

The costs of inaction are undeniable. The lines of scientific evidence grow only stronger and more numerous. And the window of time remaining to act is growing smaller: delay could mean that warming becomes “locked in.”

A market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be the best path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, but that is unachievable in the current political gridlock in Washington. Dealing with this political reality, President Obama’s June climate action plan lays out achievable actions that would deliver real progress. He will use his executive powers to require reductions in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the nation’s power plants and spur increased investment in clean energy technology, which is inarguably the path we must follow to ensure a strong economy along with a livable climate.

The president also plans to use his regulatory power to limit the powerful warming chemicals known as hydrofluorocarbons and encourage the United States to join with other nations to amend the Montreal Protocol to phase out these chemicals. The landmark international treaty. which took effect in 1989, already has been hugely successful in solving the ozone problem.

Rather than argue against his proposals, our leaders in Congress should endorse them and start the overdue debate about what bigger steps are needed and how to achieve them — domestically and internationally.

As administrators of the E.P.A under Presidents Richard M. Nixon. Ronald Reagan. George
Bush and George W. Bush, we held fast to common-sense conservative principles — protecting the health of the American people, working with the best technology available and trusting in the innovation of American business and in the market to find the best solutions for the least cost.

Page 3

That approach helped us tackle major environmental challenges to our nation and the world: the pollution of our rivers, dramatized when the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire in 1969; the hole in the ozone layer; and the devastation wrought by acid rain.

The solutions we supported worked, although more must be done. Our rivers no longer burn. and their health continues to improve. The United States led the world when nations came together to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals. Acid rain diminishes each year, thanks to a pioneering market-based emissions—trading system adopted under the first President Bush in 1990. And despite critics” warnings, our economy has continued to grow.

Climate change puts all our progress and our successes at risk. If we could articulate one
framework for successful governance, perhaps it should be this: When confronted by a problem, deal with it. Look at the facts, cut through the extraneous, devise a workable solution and get it done.

We can have both a strong economy and a livable climate. All parties know that we need both. The rest of the discussion is either detail, which we can resolve. or purposeful delay, which we should not tolerate.

Mr. Obama’s plan is just a start. More will be required. But we must continue efforts to reduce the climate-altering pollutants that threaten our planet. The only uncertainty about our warming world is how bad the changes will get, and how soon. What is most clear is that there is no time to waste.

The writers are former administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency: William D. Ruckelshaus, from its founding in 1970 to 1973, and again from 1983 to 1985; Lee M. Thomas from 1985 to 1989; William K. Reilly, from 1989 t0 1993; and Christine Todd Whitman, from 2001 to 2003.

Senator WHITEHOUSE. They are four in a large choir of voices 
singing the same tune on this issue. Major corporations are con-
cerned about climate change and have already started reducing 
their own emissions. The BICEP climate declaration is signed by 
more than 750 companies, including nameplate American brands 
like eBay, Gap, Levi, L’Oreal, Mars, Nike and Starbucks. 
The declaration states, in part, ‘‘We cannot risk our kids’ futures 
on the false hope that the vast majority of scientists are wrong. 
Leading is what we have always done and by working together, re-
gardless of politics, we will do it again.’’ I will enter a copy of that 
declaration into the record, without objection.

RE: Business Support for Proposed Carbon Pollution Standard for Existing Power Plants

Dear President Obama.

As businesses concerned about the immediate and long-term implications of climate change. we, the undersigned strongly support the principles behind the draft Carbon Pollution Standard for existing power plants released today. The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed Carbon Pollution Standard for existing power plants represents a critical step in moving our country towards a clean energy economy.

Our support is firmly grounded in economic reality. We know that tackling climate change is one of America's greatest economic opportunities of the 215' century and we applaud the EPA for taking steps to help the country seize that opportunity.

Our businesses represent many different sectors of the economy and we recognize the importance of flexibility in choosing a path that is most effective and efficient in meeting the goals we have each set within our respective companies. That is why we are pleased to see that EPA's proposed rule allows individual states to utilize a number of flexible strategies to comply with the proposed standard.

We are especially pleased to see an approach that catalyzes energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment. Clean energy policies are good for our environment. the economy, and companies. Increasingly, businesses rely on renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions to improve corporate performance and cut costs. In 2012. a study by Ceres. Calvert Investments and the World Wildlife Fund revealed that 60 percent of the combined Fortune 100 and Global 100 companies have set a renewable energy goal. a greenhouse gas reduction goal or both. In short. a majority of the world’s largest
companies are investing in clean energy and reducing emissions. Today’s rules will help spur investment and provide the long—term certainty necessary for our businesses to thrive and to meet these goals.

The new standards will reinforce what leading companies already know: climate change poses real financial risks and substantial economic opportunities and we must act now. We applaud your

administration for its commitment to tackling climate change and we encourage your timely pursuit of the finalization and implementation of these standards

Senator WHITEHOUSE. National defense leaders have sounded the 
alarm that climate change is a serious national security threat. 
There are also scientists, outdoorsmen, faith leaders, State and 
local officials and countless others demanding action. 

I understand that many of my colleagues are from States that 
depend on fossil fuels and have fossil fuel economies. They want to 
protect jobs in those industries. I get that and it is proper, but I 
also ask that they look at the other side of the ledger, the side of 
the ledger that affects States like Rhode Island. 

Our side of the ledger includes costs like damage to coastal 
homes, infrastructure and businesses from rising seas, erosion and 
storm surge, hospitalizations and missed school and work days for 
the families of kids suffering from asthma attacks triggered by 
smog, forests dying from beetle infestations and destroyed by un-
precedented wildfire seasons, farms ravaged by worsened drought 
and flooding. Our side of the ledger counts too. Do not pretend we 
do not exist. 

Recently, the EPA used its Clean Air authority as an established 
by Congress and affirmed by the Supreme Court to propose carbon 
pollution standards for the Country’s existing power plants. As pro-
posed, the rule will reduce carbon pollution while providing as 
much as $93 billion in public benefit per year by 2030. 

As you can see from this chart, a recent Washington Post, ABC 
News poll, found that 70 percent of the public supports Federal 
standards to limit greenhouse gas pollution. I am not sure if it is 
clear but the rightmost bar is Republicans who overwhelmingly 
support power plant regulations. 

Just this morning, the Wall Street Journal and an NBC news re-
leased polling data saying two-thirds of Americans support Presi-
dent Obama’s new climate rule and more than half said the U.S. 
should address global warming even if it means higher electric 
bills. 

The effects of climate change are apparent across our Country. 
At the Newport tide gauge, sea level is up almost 10 inches since 
the 1930’s. What do you think will happen when a hurricane as 
powerful as the devastating hurricane of 1938 rolls into the shores 
of Rhode Island on seas that are 10 inches higher? 

Louisiana is losing a football field of wetlands every hour due in 
part to sea level rise. According to measurements at NOAA’s Dol-
phin Island Station, sea level rise is up five inches along the Ala-
bama coast between 1966 and 2006. That is five more inches of 
ocean to batter Mobile Bay during storms. 

Then there is Florida, ground zero for climate change. In October 
2012, streets and homes in Hendricks Isle, Florida were flooded but 
not because of a storm. It all happened on a beautiful, sunny day. 
It was just extreme high tides pushed into the town by sea level 
rise. Climate change is a challenge we have a solemn duty to solve. 
Again, I thank the witnesses for joining us. The committee has 
much to learn from the collective experience of the former Adminis-
trators as we address this American challenge.

photo]. Louisiana is losing a football field of wetlands every hour due in part to sea 
level rise. According to measurements at NOAA’s Dauphin Island station, sea level 
has risen approximately five inches along the Alabama coast between 1966 and 
2006. In addition to eroding the coastline, that’s five more inches of ocean that bat-
ter Mobile Bay during storms. And then there is Florida, ground zero for climate 
change. In October 2012, streets and homes in Hendrick’s Isle, FL, were flooded— 
but not because of a storm. It all happened on a beautiful sunny day. It was just 
extreme high tides, pushed into the town by sea-level rise. 

Climate change is a challenge that can and must be solved. Again I thank the 
witnesses for joining us. The committee has much to learn from the collective expe-
rience of the four former administrators as we address this urgent threat. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. I went over by a minute so Senator Vitter 
will have an extra minute.

consent request that at least 10 or 12 more folks be let in for this 
important discussion. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. I would be happy to allow folks to be let 
into the extent that there are empty chairs that are not reserved 
for anyone. We will let the committee staff sort that out. 

Senator VITTER. Let me clarify. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. One of the people who is not here is one 
of your witnesses. 

Senator VITTER. We will keep the seat for him. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. I assume that he has staff with him, so I 
want to be polite to your witness. 

Senator VITTER. I think that is permission for about 10 other 
folks to come in. Thank you. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID VITTER, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA 

I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses here today, 
certainly including Dr. Daniel Botkin, Dr. Joseph Mason and Hon. 
Luther Strange. 

The science and economic consequences and legal underpinnings 
of the EPA’s actions to advance the President’s climate action plan 
are topics the Administration does not want to discuss in detail. 
However, their unilateral actions will increase America’s elec-
tricity bills, decrease family disposable income and result in real 
job losses for little or no measurable impact on our ever changing 
climate. 

On June 2, EPA proposed an unprecedented rule targeting our 
Country’s electricity system. Using a provision in the Clean Air Act 
that has only been used five times in 40 years, EPA requires States 
to set performance standards that apply to the entire electricity 
system, mandating renewable energy and rationing energy on 
which families and businesses rely. 

EPA argues that this rule is a gift to States that provides States 
with flexibility. In reality, that is a complete red herring. States 
are forced into achieving questionable emission reduction targets 
from a limited menu of economically damaging and legally ques-
tionable options. 

States are left little choice but to join or create regional cap and 
trade programs which achieves the Administration’s goal of making 
sure we all pay more for energy. 

Electricity prices right now in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Ini-
tiative States and California are 45 percent higher than in my 
home State of Louisiana. Fifty-six percent of Louisiana families al-
ready spend at that lower rate an average of 21 percent of their 
after tax income on energy. They simply cannot afford the higher 
electricity bills that will inevitably result from this rule. 
The rule is billed as climate change mitigation with America 
leading the way. Unfortunately, anyone who has actually read the 
645 page rule finds it has no material effect on global average tem-
perature or sea level rise. The major of the benefits touted by EPA 
come from double accounting reductions of other emissions already 
regulated through other measures.

While this Administration expects other governments to consider 
the global consequences of their greenhouse emissions when regu-
lating, there is absolutely no reason to presume the world’s biggest 
emitters will follow us down this path of economic destruction. 
In fact, much of the world is changing course. Our friends in Eu-
rope have adopted similar carbon constraining frameworks several 
years ago, filled with government mandates and cronyism and were 
rewarded with harsh economic pain. 

In an effort to recover, Germany is lifting its ban on fracking and 
increasing the use of coal. Spain is abandoning the handouts that 
supported its renewable energy program. Instead of embracing our 
domestic energy resources and the bright economic light they pro-
vide in our otherwise poor economy, this climate action plan moves 
us beyond coal and beyond natural gas with serious negative con-
sequences. 

Today, the American electricity system provides affordable, reli-
able power, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to families, schools, 
hospitals and businesses. The existing source rule as proposed will 
increase costs to all consumers significantly. As always, that espe-
cially hits the poor, the elderly and those on fixed incomes for no 
measurable effect on climate change. 

In reality, this rule is essentially a Federal takeover of the Amer-
ican electricity system. Is everyone here really comfortable with the 
EPA being fully, completely responsible for all of those details of 
our electricity system? 

The only thing missing from this strategy is an empty promise 
from the President. If you like your affordable energy, you can keep 
your affordable energy. We like it, we want to keep it. This rule 
will destroy it. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Vitter. 

I will turn now to the wonderful Chairman of the Environment 
and Public Works Committee, who I am very honored to have here 
today, a great leader in this effort, Barbara Boxer. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
Senator BOXER. Thank you, Senator. 

Thanks to your work, we are joined by an extraordinary panel. 
I thank all of you for being here. 

We are looking at four former Administrators of the EPA—this 
is really historic—who were appointed by Republican Presidents. 
The Honorable William Ruckelshaus served as the first EPA Ad-
ministrator under President Nixon and then again under President 
Reagan. The Honorable Lee Thomas served under President 
Reagan. The Honorable William Reilly served under President 
George H.W. Bush. The Honorable Christine Todd Whitman served 
under President George W. Bush. 

I am proud of our landmark environmental laws we created with 
an overwhelming bipartisan consensus. It saddens me more than I 
can ever express in words that protecting the environment at this 
Federal level has become an out and out war, a partisan issue. It 
should not be that way; it wasn’t when I started.

In 1970, the Clean Air Act passed the Senate by a vote of 73 to 
0, passed by the House by a vote of 375 to 1, was signed by Presi-
dent Nixon. In 1990, revisions to the Clean Air Act passed the Sen-
ate by a vote of 89 to 11, by 401 to 21 in the House and was signed 
into law by President George H.W. Bush. 

In the last Congress, the Republicans sent us over 90 anti-clean 
air riders. They are planning to do it now in the back rooms. They 
are working on plans to overturn President Obama’s action plan to 
cut back on carbon pollution. 

We all should know that we need to take action to reduce harm-
ful carbon pollution—97 percent of the scientists agree it is leading 
to dangerous climate change that threatens our families. To say we 
cannot have an opinion, as some of my Republican colleagues have 
done because they are not scientists—you heard them say it. 
Speaker Boehner said it. He said, I am not a scientist. I can’t say 
whether there is climate change. All the more reason to listen to 
a scientist if you are not a scientist. 

We all have health problems in our families and right here in the 
Senate. When doctors tell us we need a heart bypass or cancer 
treatment, we listen. We don’t just say, I am not a doctor, I am not 
going to listen. 

The four former EPA Administrators with us today will testify 
about the need to control carbon pollution to avoid the most calami-
tous impacts of climate change such as rising sea levels, dangerous 
heat waves and economic disruption. 
The American people certainly understand this threat. You saw 
the poll. It is extraordinary. Democrats, Republicans and independ-
ents support the President’s plan. 

As someone with a 95 percent labor record, I want to talk a 
minute about jobs. I want to welcome the people here who work 
with their hands because I respect the work that you do, but I 
want to say two things now. 

One, I want to put in the record the number of jobs in the coal 
industry under George W. Bush, the number of jobs in the coal in-
dustry under President Obama and there are more jobs under 
President Obama. There is a lot of talk around here but a lot of 
times we don’t look at the facts, so I will put this in the record with 
your permission.

Senator BOXER. I also want to say that I lived through all this 
fear mongering about jobs. Between 1970 and 2011, in 1970, we 
passed the Clean Air Act amendments. People were shouting, you 
are a job killer, you are a job killer. What happened? Air pollution 
dropped 68 percent saving our families’ health while the U.S. gross 
domestic product grew 212 percent. Private sector jobs increased by 
88 percent during that same period. 

These scare tactics have been tried before and they are just not 
real. When you look in my State and see the number of jobs that 
have been created as we moved to clean energy, it is very, very en-
couraging. 

Power plants account for 40 percent of all carbon pollution re-
leased into the air. Right now there are no limits to the amount 
of pollution that can be released, carbon pollution, from those 
power plants. 

This is what the President’s plan will do. It will avoid up to 6,600 
premature deaths, 150,000 asthma attacks, 3,300 heart attacks, 
2,800 hospital admissions and 490,000 missed days at school and 
work. 

I ask you, colleagues, when you go home, you speak to kids all 
the time. Ask them how many have asthma or know someone with 
asthma. Half the kids will raise their hands. Why would you attack 
a plan that will avoid so many heart attacks, asthma attacks, 
150,000 asthma attacks? 

It is in America’s DNA to turn a problem into an opportunity. 
Let us do it because I will tell you like many other jobs, you cannot 
outsource putting a solar roof on a home, you cannot outsource put-
ting a wind turbine in place. 

I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for his extraordinary leader-
ship. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. I am now pleased to recognize my friend 
from Wyoming, the distinguished Senator Barrasso. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING 

Senator BARRASSO. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
As you know, I am from Wyoming, the most beautiful State in 
the Nation and I want to keep it that way. I believe we have and 
can have a healthy environment and a health economy at the same 
time. We need to do that by striking the right balance between the 
two. 

I believe it is irresponsible to impose costly regulations without 
having real environmental benefits. The cost of these climate 
change regulations on families and on communities is very real. 
The benefits are ill defined. They are unknown or are simply neg-
ligible. 

President Obama’s new climate regulations, which are at the 
heart of his climate action plan, will harm our fragile American 
economy, thousands of people will lose their jobs, it will raise elec-
tricity prices threaten electricity reliability and undermine Amer-
ica’s global competitiveness. 

Higher energy costs will hurt low income families and fixed in-
come seniors the most, leaving them with less to spend on food, 
housing, health care and other basic necessities. The thousands of

Page 19 

unemployed and their families will suffer negative health impacts 
as a result of chronic unemployment. Electricity prices and hospital 
visits will necessarily sky rocket. 

Is it worth subjecting many in our Country to a dramatically 
lower quality of life and health for this plan to essentially nation-
alize our electricity grid? Based on the facts, I would say absolutely 
not. 

We have been told by the U.N. and the EPA that climate change 
will cause serious impacts across the globe. To address this, the 
President put forward his Climate Action Plan. This plan is two-
fold: first, to have the U.S. nationalize our electricity grid just as 
he has tried to nationalize our healthcare system. 
Nationalizing our electricity grid means taking decisionmaking 
about electricity policy out of the hands of the States, out of the 
hands of the communities and putting it in the hands of Wash-
ington bureaucrats. 

This will occur as EPA rejects in whole or in part State energy 
plans for reducing carbon emissions and imposing their own Fed-
eral plans under the EPA’s proposed new regulations for existing 
coal-fired power plants. This will happen at a cost of thousands of 
jobs and the public’s health and well being. 

The second part of the President’s plan is to have us believe that 
he can arrive in Paris in 2015 at the U.N. Climate Change Con-
ference and convince the world to follow his lead. The whole plan 
hinges on President Obama’s foreign policy prowess. His foreign 
policy record is a series of empty threats, pivots, resets, missed cal-
culations and lead from behind failures in places like Syria, Russia, 
Iran, Libya and now Iraq. 

After all those missteps, the President expects Americans to be-
lieve that in 2015, he can draw a red line along the Champs- 
Elyseesys and demand that China and India stop burning fossil 
fuels. Even if the President was able to reach an agreement like 
the Kyoto treaty of the 1990’s, it would still have to be ratified by 
the Senate. The treaty in the 1990’s overwhelmingly failed in the 
Senate. 

If the President cannot deliver in Paris and subsequently in the 
Senate, we will be left with his domestic climate action plan. 
Americans have been told by the EPA and the U.N. that climate 
change will cause serious impacts to the planet years into the fu-
ture. The President’s domestic climate action plan they champion 
cannot, on its own, prevent these impacts from happening. 

According to our own U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, in a 
column he wrote in the Financial Times on June 3, he stated, 
‘‘Even as we strive to do better, we recognize that no country can 
solve this problem alone.’’ Even if the U.S. somehow eliminated all 
our domestic greenhouse gas emissions, Secretary Kerry says, ‘‘It 
would not be enough. The rest of the world is spewing too much 
carbon pollution.’’ 

That means that the President’s climate action plan, on its own, 
doesn’t reduce global temperatures or prevent any of the serious 
impacts predicted by the U.N. or the EPA. It can’t even make a 
dent, all the while seniors on fixed incomes, families and children 
suffer high electricity bills, joblessness and poor health.

This is all pain and little gain with what the President is pro-
posing. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Barrasso. 
Thanks to the kindness of Senator Cardin, Senator Sanders will 
be recognized. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BERNARD SANDERS, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT 

Senator SANDERS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank 
you for your tireless efforts on this issue and for organizing this 
very important hearing today. 

I say this as somebody who may have the highest pro-labor vot-
ing record in the U.S. Congress, my delight in hearing some of my 
friends on the other side express their interest about the needs of 
low income people, working people and senior citizens. 
I would remind everyone that many of these same people are 
folks who have fought to cut social security, Medicare, Medicaid, 
opposed raising the minimum wage, opposed the kind of jobs pro-
gram we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and put mil-
lions of people back work and opposed lowering college debts for 
many struggling students in this Country. 

The issue we are dealing with today is of enormous importance. 
It really comes down to whether as a Nation, as the most powerful 
nation on earth, we are going to listen to the science. When we 
build weapons systems that cost billions of dollars, we take it for 
granted that the engineers know what they are talking about. 
When we invest in cancer research through the National Institutes 
of Health, we assume and believe that the doctors and scientists 
know what they are talking about. 

Right now, we are in a very strange moment in American his-
tory. That is why traditionally there are differences of opinion on 
labor issues, on health care issues and that is what happens year 
after year. We are now in a very strange moment and that is we 
have virtually an entire political party that is rejecting basic 
science and the science is no longer in doubt. 

Some 97 percent of scientists who have written in peer-reviewed 
journals say the following. Climate change is real, it is significantly 
caused by human activity, and it is already causing devastating 
problems in our Country and throughout the world. 

Yesterday, the newspapers reported that in Arizona, they are 
worrying about how Phoenix and other cities are going to get water 
because of the terrible drought we have seen in the southwest. 
Australia is burning up. We have had extreme weather disturb-
ances, major storms that have cost us billions and billions of dol-
lars. Sea levels are rising which may flood among other cities, the 
great city of New Orleans, New York City and Boston. 
For some strange reason, while we agree on science in almost 
every area of our life, in this area we have a party that says, no, 
climate change is not real; it is maybe a hoax, something concocted 
by Al Gore or Hollywood. 

I am very proud today and want to thank the panelists who are 
here very much, especially the former EPA Administrators who 
were appointed by Republicans. I thank you so much for being here

because while we can disagree on a million issues, we should not 
disagree on what scientists tell us. We should not disagree when 
scientists tell us that we have a window of opportunity, 10 or 15 
years, to turn this thing around, to lead the world. 
John Kerry said the rest of the world has to go forward. He is 
right but somebody has got to lead. This Country leads. By the 
way, when we lead in transforming our energy system away from 
fossil fuel, we create millions of jobs through weatherization, 
through energy efficiency, through wind and solar, geothermal and 
other technologies that are out there. 

I very much want to thank the former Republican Administra-
tors for coming to Washington to say what I think is true nation-
ally, that intelligent Republicans all over this Country—I am not 
a Republican, my views are very different—but on this issue we 
can at least respect science, we can respect the planet, we can 
transform our energy system and most importantly, maybe at the 
end of the day, we have a moral responsibility for our children and 
grandchildren so that 30 years from now, they do not look us in 
the eye and say, all the scientists told you what was going on, why 
didn’t you do something. We have to do something. 
I thank you all very much for being here this morning. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Sanders. 

Senator Inhofe. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES INHOFE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA 

Senator INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for hold-
ing the hearing. 

While I think it is important for us to conduct oversight over the 
ESPS rule, we need to be hearing from Gina McCarthy and Janet 
McCabe and from those who would be affected by the rule which 
includes the utilities, the consumers, the manufacturers, the min-
ers and others. 

We need the record to reflect the whole picture of this rule. We 
need to hear from the experts on electricity reliability like FERC 
and NERC. 

During his time in office, President Obama has pursued a sys-
tematic strategy for using the government to take over major sec-
tors of the economy. He started with Obamacare, nationalizing the 
healthcare system. He went on to Dodd-Frank, making bank bail-
outs a permanent fixture in American society. 

Now we have the first round of global warming regulations which 
would nationalize the electricity market and force Americans to 
live out the President’s green dream. We don’t have to look any fur-
ther to see Obama’s marvel in Germany to see where the path 
leads. 

I think Senator Vitter covered this pretty well. The fact that they 
are now trying to get out from under the mess they are in. Ger-
many’s cost per kilowatt hour has doubled and is now triple what 
it is here in the United States, all because of the course the Presi-
dent has tried to put us on. 

The Administration may claim that this is unlikely because the 
United States has an abundance of cheap, domestic sources of nat-
ural gas. While that is true, I am not naive enough to believe that 

VerDate Aug 31 2005 10:54 Feb 25, 2016 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\_EPW\DOCS\98181.TXT VERN

the Administration will stop with coal. In fact, Energy Secretary 
Ernest Monis recently said that natural gas power plants will soon 
need carbon capture sequestration technology and saw it on them 
to comply with global warming rules. That would put them out of 
business. 

It is not just coal. It is oil, gas, coal and even nuclear that is 
under attack. Ultimately, President Obama’s electricity takeover 
will force Americans to use less and less electricity at higher and 
higher prices. The motive is clear. 

I am going to ask that this be made a part of the record. Tom 
Steyer is a California billionaire who has promised to pump $100 
million into the elections to help Senate Democrats get elected if 
they make global warming a national issue. 

This isn’t me saying this; this is Tom Steyer. I don’t have $100 
million to give away, he does and this means enough to him. I do 
ask this be made a part of the record. 

Senator SANDERS. Reserving the right to object. 

Senator INHOFE. That is fine. 

Senator SANDERS. I would also like to enter into the record the 
fact that the Koch Brothers representing the fossil fuel industry 
will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on this campaign trying 
to defeat Democrats. 

Senator INHOFE. Do you object to having this a part of the 
record? 

Senator SANDERS. So long as mine is able to be entered, I have 
no objection. 

Senator INHOFE. Sure, you can enter it. That is fine. 

Senator SANDERS. Thank you. 

Senator INHOFE. By the way, I have the greatest respect for Sen-
ator Sanders. We are totally different on our philosophies, I under-
stand that, but we have respect for each other. We have had honest 
debates and this is just one of them. 
I think it is very important that we keep in mind there is a guy 
out there. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. The timer will go back on and both docu-
ments will be admitted into the record.

Koch Brothers Unveil New Strategy at
Big Donor Retreat

The Koch brothers‘ financial network is planning on spending almost
$300 million in the 2014 election. including a new anti-environment
effort.

In the face of expanding energy regulations, stepped-up Democratic attacks and the ongoing fight over Ohamacare, the billionaire Koch brothers and scores of wealthy allies have set an initial 2014 fundraising target of $290 million which should boost GOP candidates and support dozens of conservative groups —-including a new energy initiative with what looks like a deregulatory, pro-consumer spin, The Daily Beast has learned.

This weekend, at a posh California resort near Laguna Beach, energy is expected to be among the topics as Charles and David Koch and their extensive donor network hold a semiannual fundraising and policy seminar. Political allies including Son. Marco Rubio 01' Florida and libertarian political scientist Charles Murray are slated to speak, according to conservatives familiar with the Koch network.

The energy initiative is being created under the umbrella of the largest Koch network nonprofit in apparent response to a number of developments the commitment by liberal billionaire Tom Steyer to steer $100 million into ads in several states to make climate change a priority issue in the elections; numerous setbacks at the state level where Koch network backed advocacy groups have been fighting against.

renewable energy standards; and the new EPA regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.

The meeting will cap a frenetic fundraising season for the conservative donor network. This year the Koch network not only hosted a similar January conference, but several smaller gatherings in Palm Springs, Newport Beach, St. Louis, and other locales to
attract new donors, according to an email from Koch fundraising honcho Kevin
Gentry obtained by The Daily Beast. In his email, Gentry called the Palm Springs event — which drew some 50 wealthy conservatives in March — a “highly successful recruitment reception” and encouraged other veteran donors to get involved by holding local gatherings in their areas Koch network operatives also have held periodic conference calls—sometimes with members of Congress on the line—to update loyal check writers on various issues and keep them in the fold, say conservative sources.

Now, hitting the $290 million goal seems within reach: almost $170 million of that total was pledged at the last big Koch donor seminar in January this year, say two conservative sources The hefty haul will help fund a mix of politically active nonprofits like the Koch backed Americans for Prosperity, and a newer outfit called the Libre Initiative that‘s aimed at appealing to Hispanics with a small government, free—market message. AFP alone is expected to spend upwards of $125 million this year on a variety of political and advocacy projects including air and ground operations, according to Politico.

By comparison, in the 2012 presidential cycle, the Koch donor network raised
more than $400 million to help underwrite 17 politically active nonprofit groups
-including AFP and Libre Initiative — according to The Washington Post.

A few Koch network — backed nonprofit groups including APP have long fought
against climate change regulations, a carbon tax, and subsidies for renewable
energy. But lately, the Koch universe seem to be facing bigger energy threats
stemming from Washington, state governments and big liberal checkbooks.

The new energy initiative is the handiwork of Freedom Partners Chamber of
Commerce, the Koch network‘s central fundraising hub, which was established
in late 2011 as a trade group, according to an email to the group's members
from Gentry. In 2012, the fledgling group — which claims some zoo members
who each kick in at least $100,000 yearly — funneled over $230 million dollars
to numerous other nonprofits in the Koch ecosystem according to the group’s
2012 tax returns.

In an April 1 missive, Gentry invited Freedom Partners members to join an
upcoming conference ml} about a “significant new Freedom Partners initiative”
which he touted as one that would “drive the national narrative around energy

The Daily Beast and the tremendous benefits of reliable affordable energy for all Americans, especially for the less fortunate." T he email indicated that discussions about the energy project began last summer at another Koch donor event in New Mexico, which drew outgoing House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Rep. Paul Ryan among others.

Gentry's email stressed that liberal donors, led by hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer have plans to spend as much as $100 million on climate change issues and ads to make it a top-tier issue in the election, He noted that environmental groups had recently run a $5 million "clean energy" ad blitz in Iowa, Michigan, and North Carolina, all of which are considered "focus" states for Freedom Partners and among the states where Americans for Prosperity has spent over $35 million on attack ads against Democratic Senate candidates on Obamacare.

In a chagrined-sounding PS, Gentry opined that the “new multi million dollar campaign by environmentalists is arguably an effort to distract from the failures of Obamacare. But you and I know energy is a critically important issue
for the United States."

The details and scope of the new energy initiative, which has not been announced, aren't clear yet, but it’s expected to cost in the seven figures and be a topic at the Koch donor conference this — especially in light of the Obama administration's newly unveiled EPA regulations to curb carbon emissions from mostly coal fired power plants. Two sources familiar with Koch donor world told The Daily Beast that a new nonprofit group is being formed to help run the new energy initiative, Neither spokesmen for Freedom Partners or Koch Industries responded to requests for comment about the new initiative or fundraising efforts this year.

The Koch brothers combined net worth exceeds 380 billion, according to Forbes magazine, and is derived from their control of Koch Industries, the eponymous energy and manufacturing conglomerate

Based on Gentry’s email and recent energy drives by other Koch network groups, the initiative is likely to mix a minimalist regulatory and free-market message with a pro-consumer spin.

On its website, Freedom Partners explains its energy policy goals very broadly as “increasing access to affordable energy that helps societies-businesses, families and especially the poor—prosper and thrive." It says that the role of federal government is to “administer smart and safe environmental regulations" but argues that too often there's a lack of transparency and that “unsound science" is used to justify decisions Without weighing costs versus benefits

The new energy initiative may partly stem from setbacks in many states where advocacy groups funded by the Koch network like Americans for Prosperity and allies have been waging mostly uphill battles to rollback renewable energy
standards In these fights the conservative nonprofits have often portrayed renewable mandates as very expensive for consumers, a point that‘s frequently been rebutted by independent groups.

Even as Kansas, the home of Koch Industries, the Koch-backed advocacy

Page 26


network failed to repeal the state's renewable standards, which were enacted in 2009 Under Kansas' Renewable Portfolio Standard, 20 percent of the state‘s electricity is supposed to come from renewables by the year 2020.

The Kansas fight suggests part of the strategy that Koch—linked groups are expected to pursue to broaden their message and try to appeal to consumers. Alan Cobb, a former lobbyist for the company who also did stints with AFP and Freedom Partners, was hired this spring by the newly created Kansas Senior Consumer Alliance, which sent thousands of postcards to elderly citizens criticizing the renewable standards. The postcards, with pictures of worried- looking seniors opening their mail, said that there had been 15 rate hikes since 2009 when the renewable standards were enacted and urged seniors to contact their representatives to protest them.

A state commission has found less than 2 percent of recent rate increases can be attributed to the renewable standards.

Groups backed by the Koch network in several other states have also been rebuffed in their drives against renewables, But in late May, in a rare victory, Ohio Governor John Kasich signed off on a two—year freeze on the Buckeye
State's renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements

On the 2014 electoral front, other Koch donor supported nonprofit groups like the American Energy Alliance (AHA) have poured funds into ads targeting Democrats in close Senate and House races, knocking their opposition to building the Keystone XL pipeline. In May, the ABA spent over 8400.000 on ads in Colorado attacking Sen. Mark Udall for his stance opposing the Keystone
pipeline. AEA, which is run by former Koch Industries lobbyist Tom Pyle, has also been fighting to end wind energy subsidies. Last year, Congress ended a two decade old tax credit for wind energy companies after vigorous lobbying by
Koch-backed groups including ABA and AFP. This year the groups have continued to fight against attempts to revive the credit.

The fight over climate change took a personal twist this spring when Tom Steyer challenged the Koch brothers to a debate about the issue and whether more regulations are needed to curb man-made pollution. The Koch brothers turned down the invitation. In an email to a local Kansas paper, Koch spokesperson Melissa Cohlmia explained “we are not experts on climate change."

The Koch seminar this weekend is scheduled to feature a speech by Sen. Marco Rubio (It-FL), who last month sparked a small firestorm when he said that "I don’t believe that “human activity is causing these dramatic changes in our climate the way these scientists are portraying it." Rubio, whose view is contradicted by many scientific studies showing that carbon dioxide emissions
have accelerated global warming, added that he thinks proposed laws to deal with climate change “will only wreck our economy." Rubio's position should get a warm reception among the libertarian leaning donors at the conference

Koch-backed political network, built to shield donors, raised $400 million in 2012 elections

BY MATEA GOLD, January 5

The political network spearheaded by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch has expanded into a far-reaching operation of unrivaled complexity, built around a maze of groups that cloaks its donors, according to an analysis of new tax returns and other documents.

The filings show that the network of politically active nonprofit groups backed by the Kochs and fellow donors in the 2012 elections financially outpaced other independent groups on the right and, on its own, matched the long-established national coalition of labor unions that serves as one of the biggest sources of support for Democrats.

The resources and the breadth of the organization make it singular in American politics: an operation conducted outside the campaign finance system, employing an array of groups aimed at stopping what its financiers view as government overreach. Members of the coalition target different constituencies but together have mounted attacks on the new health-care law, federal spending and environmental regulations.

Key players in the Koch—backed network have already begun engaging in the 2014 midterm elections, hiring new staff members to expand

Page 28

operations and strafing House and Senate Democrats with hard-hitting ads over their support for the Affordable Care Act.

Its funders remain largely unknown; the coalition was carefully constructed with extensive legal barriers to shield its donors.

But they have substantial firepower. Together, the 17 conservative groups that made up the network raised at least $407 million
during the 2012 campaign, according to the analysis of tax returns by The Washington Post and the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics.

A labyrinth of tax-exempt groups and limited-liability companies helps mask the sources of the money, much of which went to voter mobilization and television ads attacking President Obama and congressional Democrats, according to tax filings and campaign finance reports.

The coalition’s revenue surpassed that of the Crossroads organizations, a super PAC and nonprofit group co—founded by GOP strategist Karl Rove that together brought in $325 million in the last cycle.

The left has its own financial muscle, of course; unions plowed roughly $400 million into national, state and local elections in 201.2. A network of wealthy liberal donors organized by the group Democracy Alliance
mustered about $100 million for progressive groups and super PACs in the last election cycle, according to a source familiar with the totals.

The donor network organized by the Kochs -— along with funding an array of longtime pro-Republican groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and Americans for Tax Reform — distributed money to a
coalition of groups that share the brothers’ libertarian, free-market perspective. Each group was charged with a specialized task such as youth outreach, Latino engagement or data crunching.

The system involved roughly a dozen limited-liability companies with
cryptic, alphabet-soup names such as SLAH LLC and ORRA LLC, and entities that dissolved and reappeared under different monikers.

Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a University of Notre Dame law School professor who studies the tax issues of politically active nonprofits, said he has never seen a network with a similar design in the tax-exempt world.


Page 29

“It is a very sophisticated and complicated structure,” said Mayer, who examined some of the groups’ tax filings. “It’s designed to make it opaque as to where the money is coming from and where the money is going. No layperson thought this up. It would only be worth it if you were spending the kind of dollars the Koch brothers are, because this was not cheap."

Tracing the ﬂow of the money is particularly challenging because many of the advocacy groups swapped funds back and forth. The tactic not only provides multiple layers of protection for the original donors but also allows the groups to claim they are spending the money on “social welfare" activities to qualify for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status.

Such maneuvers could he sharply restricted under new regulations proposed by the Internal Revenue Service in November.~The- new rules seek to rein in nonprofit groups that have increasingly engaged in elections while avoiding the donor disclosure required of political committees;

The donors

It is unclear how much of the network's funds came directly from the Kochs, who head Koch Industries, one of the largest privately held companies in the country. The brothers, who fund a host of libertarian think tanks and advocacy groups, are heralded on the right and pilloried on the left for their largess.

While “the Koch network " has become a shorthand in political circles, the coalition is financed by a large pool of other conservative donors as well, according to people Who participate in the organization.

Through a corporate spokesman, the Kochs declined to comment on what support they give. “Koch’s involvement in political and public policy activities is at the core of fundamental liberties protected by the first Amendment to the United

Page 30

States Constitution," Koch Industries spokesman Robert Tappan said in an e-mailed statement, ‘This type of activity is undertaken by individual donors and organizations on all ends of the political spectrum -- on the left, the middle, and the right. In many situations, the law does not compel disclosure of donors to various causes and organizations,”

Tappan added that “Koch has been targeted repeatedly in the past by the Administration and its allies because of our real (or, in some cases, perceived) beliefs and activities concerning public policy and political issues."

In a rare in-person interview with Forbes in late 2012, Charles Koch defended the need for venues that allow donors to give money without public disclosure, saying such groups provide protection from the kind of attacks his family and company have weathered,

“We get death threats, threats to blowup our facilities, kill our people. We get Anonymous and other groups trying to crash our IT systems,” he said, referring to the computer-hacking collective. “So long as we‘re in a society like that, where the president attacks us and we get threats from people in Congress, and this is pushed out and becomes part of the culture - that we are evil, so we need to be destroyed, or killed —- then why force people to disclose?"

Since 2003, the Kochs have hosted twice-yearly seminars with like-minded donors at which they collect pledges for groups that share their commitment to deregulation and free markets

Jack Schuler, a Chicago health—care entrepreneur, attended one of the Kochs’ donor meetings in Beaver Creek, Colo, several years ago and has contributed about $100,000 a year to their efforts since then.

“They came across as guys who are putting a lot of their own money into it,”

Page 31

Schuler said. “They are pretty soft-spoken, not screamers or screechers. They provide the leadership, the staff —- without the frameWork, I wouldn’t do it on my own.“

Many donors get involved because they “value the privacy afforded to them by giving to these entities,” said Phil Kerpen, president of American Commitment, a nonprofit free-market advocacy group that is part of the network.

‘There are hundreds and hundreds of very successful and patriotic Americans that take part in the seminars,” Kerpen added.-
anything that goes through any of these entities is Charles and David Koch is very misleading. There are a significant number of donors involved.”

The money

Much of the money that ﬂowed through the network in the last election; cycle originated with two nonprofit groups that served as facto banks, feeding money to groups downstream, according to an analysis by center for Responsive Politics researcher Robert Maguire, who investigates politically active nonprofits.

The biggest was the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, an Arlington County-based group set up in November 2011 that now functions as the major funding arm of the network, according to people-familiar with the operation. The organization, whose board includes current and former Koch Industries officials, brought in nearly $256 million in its first year “significantly more revenue than was expected,”‘according to its tax filing.

Nearly $150 million was in the form of dues paid by more than 200
members of the organization, which is structured as a business league. An additional $105.8 million came from something called “SA Fund."

James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, said the organization

 

Page 32

funds groups “based on whether or not they advance the common business interests of our members in promoting economic opportunity and free-market principles."

Davis said the group has been upfront about its spending and made its tax return available online as soon as it was filed in September.

“Our members are free to disclose their affiliation if they wish," he said. “We leave that decision with them. Unfortunately, recent IRS and other instances of intimidation and harassment of individuals and groups because of their policy beliefs and activities demonstrate why it‘s important to keep such information confidential."

According to people familiar with the network, Freedom Partners took the place of a now-defunct group based in Alexandria called TC4 Trust, which raised more than $66 million in three years before it was shuttered in June 2012, according to tax filings.

The same tax preparer — a Kansas City, Mo. based partner in the accounting firm BKD - did the returns for Freedom Partners and TC4 Trust, as well as for nearly half the other groups in the network and for the nonprofit Charles Koch Institute.

In all, the feeder funds and the groups they financed raised an estimated $407 million in the last election cycle. That figure is a conservative one, since it does not account for the complete revenue of eight groups that have not yet filed their tax returns for the latter half of 2012.

Of the $407 million, $302 million can be traced to Freedom Partners or TC4 Trust.

The sources of the rest of the money remain a mystery, but many donors in the network write checks to the individual groups, according to people

Page 33

familiar with the system. Some of the organizations also have additional funding streams outside the network.

The structure

Freedom Partners and TC4 Trust moved a large share of their funds through an intermediary group, the Phoenix-based Center to Protect Patient Rights, which served as a major cash turnstile for groups on the right during the past two election cycles. It is run by political operative Sean Noble, who served as a Koch consultant in 2012.

Rather than finance CPPR directly, Freedom Partners and TC4 Trust* transferred $129 million to limited-liability companies with changing names that are registered in Delaware, a state that requires corporations to disclose little about their operations: Eleventh Edition (which was renamed Corner Table and then Cactus Wren) and American Commitment (which was SDN, then became Meridian Edition)

Their relationship to CPPR was unknown until May, When the Arizona group acknowledged in amended tax filings that the LLLCS were its affiliates.

Such LLCs are known as “disregarded entities," which means that for IRS purposes. they do not exist. Their revenue is reported o‘n‘the balance sheets of their parent organizations.

Tax experts said disregarded entities are typically used by nonprofits to, for example, hold a piece of real estate to shield an organization from liability. But they also can be used to make it harder to trace the movement of funds
between groups. In its final tax return, TC4 reported doling out nearly $28 million to 10 organizations with names such as POFN LLC, PRDIST LLC and TRGN LLC. Those are the affiliates of the groups Public Notice, Americans for Prosperity and Generation Opportunity, in that order.

Page 34

The Post and the Center for Responsive Politics identified the groups that make up the Koch-backed network through an analysis of tax filings, which revealed their shared DNA. Most have affiliated LLCs and received a substantial share of their revenue from the feeder funds.

The makeup of the coalition was corroborated by people familiar with the structure who said the network is ad hoc and will not necessarily remain constant.

A key player is Americans for Prosperity, the Virginia-based advocacy organization that finances activities across the country and ran an early and relentless television ad assault against Obama during the 2012 campaign. More than $44 million of the $140 million the organization raised in that election cycle came from Koch—linked feeder funds.

Other groups in the network included the American Future Fund, a Des Moines—based nonprofit that poured more than $25 million into ads against Obama and congressional Democrats in 2012; Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian women’s activist group that ran a get out-the-vote effort aimed at young women; the Libre Initiative Trust, a Texas-based group aimed at Latinos; Generation Opportunity, which seeks to engage millennials; and Themis Trust, which houses the data used by
the allied groups.

The network also distributed funds to other independent political players. In the last election, Freedom Partners and CPPR doled out millions of dollars to a wide assortment of groups on the right, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ($3 million), the NRA ($6.6 million), the National Federation of Independent Business ($25 million) and Heritage Action for America ($500,000).

Obama‘s reelection prompted internal reassessments in the network, as it did among many conservative groups that had worked to defeat him in

Page 35

2012. But there are no signs that the coalition plans to retreat. Rather, officials are focused on creating a more effective operation aimed at bolstering the conservative movement for the long term. Freedom Partners, which now has nearly 50 employees, is expected to bring many functions in-house and expand beyond grantmaking, according to people familiar with the plans. Groups such as CPPR are expected to play a smaller role going forward.

Others are already engaged in the 2014 tight. Americans for Prosperity is in the midst of a $20-million—plus ad blitz attacking congressional Democrats for their support of the health-care law, while the Libre Initiative has targeted Latinos with similar messages.

“We raised a lot of money and mobilized an awful lot of people, and we lost, plain and simple,” David Koch told Forbes shortly after Election Day. “We 're going to study what worked, what didn‘t work, and improve our efforts in the future. We’re not going to roll over and play dead.”

Senator INHOFE. Very good. Thank you. 

We have had the global warming parties on the Senate floor and 
all of that is going on but the reason guys like Tom Steyer have 
to go to such lengths to make the political issue is because the 
American people don’t want anything to do with it. 

He talks about polls. Poll after poll show more and more Ameri-
cans learn about the impact of greenhouse gas regulations, the 
more effect it will have on the economy, the less they care. The 
Gallup poll that just came out used to list global warming as No. 
1 and two. You remember that Christine back when you had that 
job. Now it is number 14 out of 15 of the major concerns. The peo-
ple have caught on to this. 

The most important issue is the economy. We know that the pre-
vious version of cap and trade are estimated to cost between $300 
billion to $400 billion a year which amounts to about $3,000 for 
every family that files a Federal tax return. Then we have to keep 
in mind even if this was right, even if they were able to do this 
and pass this, it would not reduce, as one of the members said a 
moment ago, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. 

Lisa Jackson, the Director of EPA appointed by Barack Obama, 
made that statement and said, no, it would not reduce because this 
isn’t where the problem is. It is in China, it is in India, Mexico and 
other places. 

The $3,000 per family would be something that would not 
achieve the benefits that the other side seems to think are there. 
This version is going to have a similar impact. The Chamber of 
Commerce estimated one final construct of the rule would cause 
$51 billion in lost GDP each year. The Heritage Foundation esti-
mated it would decrease household income by $1,200 a year. 
These are the facts but they are not talking about the points we 
hear from the other side. Keep in mind also they are trying to do 
this through regulation, Obama is, because he couldn’t do it 
through legislation. We have had countless bills introduced to do 
the very same thing through legislation. Each time they are intro-
duced, they are defeated by a larger margin. 

I think if for no other reason, the mere fact that it has been re-
jected by the House and the Senate is very significant. Why should 
we through regulation try to do something that the elected mem-
bers of this body have rejected over and over again? 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Inhofe follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES INHOFE, U.S. SENATOR 
FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA 

Today we are joined by four former Administrators of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency who were appointed by Republican Presidents: the Honorable William 
Ruckelshaus served as the first EPA Administrator under President Richard Nixon 
and then again under President Ronald Reagan; the Honorable Lee Thomas also 
served under President Reagan; the Honorable William Reilly served under Presi-
dent George H. W. Bush, and the Honorable Christine Todd Whitman served under 
President George W. Bush. 

I am proud that our landmark environmental laws were created with an over-
whelming bipartisan consensus, and it saddens me that protecting the environment 
at the Federal level has become a partisan issue. 
In 1970, the Clean Air Act passed the Senate by a vote of 73–0, passed the House 
by 375–1, and was signed into law by President Nixon.

In 1990, revisions to the Clean Air Act passed the Senate by a vote of 89–11and 
by 401–21 in the House, and were signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. 
But in the last Congress the Republicans then sent us over 90 anti-Clean Air rid-
ers. 

We should all know we must take action to reduce harmful carbon pollution, 
which 97 percent of scientists agree is leading to dangerous climate change that 
threatens our families. To say we can’t have an opinion because we are not sci-
entists makes no sense to me. All the more reason to listen to the scientists. 
The four former EPA Administrators with us today will testify about the need to 
control carbon pollution so we can avoid the most calamitous impacts of climate 
change—such as rising sea levels, dangerous heat waves, and economic disruption. 
The American people understand the threats posed by climate change, and they 
want action. According to a recent Washington Post-ABC poll, a bipartisan majority 
of the American people want Federal limits on carbon pollution. Approximately 70 
percent say the Federal Government should require limits to carbon pollution from 
existing power plants, and 70 percent (57 percent of Republicans, 76 percent of 
Independents, and 79 percent of Democrats) support requiring states to limit the 
amount of carbon pollution within their borders. 

Power plants account for nearly 40 percent of all carbon pollution released into 
the air. Unlike other pollutants, right now there are no limits to the amount of car-
bon pollution that can be released into the air for power plants. 
The President’s carbon pollution reduction plan will avoid up to 6,600 premature 
deaths, 150,000 asthma attacks, 3,300 heart attacks, 2,800 hospital admissions, and 
490,000 missed days at school and work. 

It is in America’s DNA to turn a problem into an opportunity, and that is what 
we have done by being a pioneer in the green technology industry. These new car-
bon pollution standards are no different. Landmark environmental laws have bol-
stered an environmental technology and services sector that employs an estimated 
3.4 million people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And many of these 
jobs, like installing solar roofs and wind turbines cannot be outsourced. 
I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for putting together this marvelous panel. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Inhofe. 

We turn now to Senator Cardin. 
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN CARDIN, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND 

Senator CARDIN. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. I thank you for 
your extraordinary leadership on this issue. You have been incred-
ibly helpful to this Country in the leadership you have taken, par-
ticularly in your comments on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
I want to start by thanking our panelists today for what you 
have done to improve the public health for the people in this Na-
tion. You have put public health first and that is what Congress 
intended when it passed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water 
Act. It was done by bipartisan votes. 

The Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 with bipartisan support 
by the Members of Congress in both the House and the Senate and 
signed into law by President Nixon. You have given us the bipar-
tisan or nonpartisan foundation for us to have clean water and 
clean air. Now we need to move forward in that tradition. Unfortu-
nately, we have not. 

I hope we can get back to the same type of spirit that inspired 
you to use your talent at the EPA as we move forward to advance 
the public health of the people of this Country. 
Seven years ago when I was first elected to the Senate, we had 
bipartisan members in the Senate working together on climate 
change legislation. I hope we can get back to that day and get that 
bipartisan coalition together. 

Quite frankly, the solution is one which will answer every mem-
ber’s concerns. Yes, many of us, most of us, are concerned about

the environmental public health threat that climate change poses. 
I have the honor of representing the State of Maryland. Our great-
est natural resource is the Chesapeake Bay. 

We are doing a lot. We have asked our farmers to do a lot. We 
have asked our developers to do a lot. Our municipal governments 
have done a lot. We have worked together in the public and private 
sector. A large part of the problem deals with climate change, ris-
ing sea levels nad the loss of sea grasses. Therefore, climate change 
affects the quality of life for the people of Maryland. 

The scientific information on our environment is pretty clear on 
public health. As pointed out, 97 percent of the published scientific 
documents indicate we have a serious threat that we can do some-
thing about and we need to take action. 

By way of example, if I went to a doctor and 97 percent of the 
opinion was that I had pneumonia and unless I took certain action, 
I was risking my health, I would take action, as would every per-
son in this Country. 

It is clear that the overwhelming evidence is that we need to 
take action and move to preserve the public health, not just of 
America, but globally and the future health of our climate. 
The good news is we don’t really have to get into debate with the 
other 3 percent because the solution to the problem of climate 
change not means a cleaner environment and a safer circumstance 
for global climate, it also helps our economy. 

I would just point to the Maryland experience. We passed some 
of the toughest environmental laws for our power plants and it cre-
ated jobs. We can show you the number of jobs that were created. 
Clean energy creates more jobs than the fossil fuel industry. 
There are those saying maybe this is not true, you certainly want 
to do it for our economic growth in this Country. It also helps us 
with national security. We have talked about that. We have made 
progress and are now more energy secure than we were a few years 
ago because we have invested in cleaner energy sources to help 
support America’s security, economy and our environment. 

I can also point to the fact that from our security point of view, 
many of our military facilities are located on the coast. In Mary-
land, we are very proud of the Naval Academy, PAX River, Aber-
deen Proving Grounds, Indian Head. All those are threatened by 
sea level increases. It is in our national security interest to do this. 
The bottom line is the United States needs to exercise leader-
ship. President Obama is doing that by his climate action agenda 
and by regulating what power plants are doing. We have seen our 
President provide the leadership that has made a huge difference. 
It is now time for Congress to step up and join the President so 
America can be a leader in dealing with this global problem that 
affects the security of our Country and affects the future of our 
globe. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Cardin. 
Our distinguished Ranking Member and my friend, Senator Ses-
sions, but he has allowed us to keep the existing order so I will rec-
ognize Senator Boozman.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BOOZMAN, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS 

Senator BOOZMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
It is good to see the miners here. It is important that you are 
here. 

One topic we are hearing a lot about today is the 97 percent con-
sensus among scientists on climate change. It is important to ask, 
where does this 97 percent number come from and what does it 
mean? 

Many scientists question the level of certainty behind the specific 
climate change scenarios. Others have shown gaps in our knowl-
edge of climate sensitivity. Others have raised questions regarding 
the reliability of climate models and yet scientists who raise any 
of these issues can still be counted as the 97 percent. 
Too often anybody who raises a question or disagrees with the 
left wing political position is called out as opposing views held by 
97 percent of the published climate scientists as we are hearing 
today. 

This is clearly not true. Again, what does this number mean? 
The statistic comes from a 2013 review of scientific literature pub-
lished between 1991 and 2011. This review found that among ab-
stracts expressing a position on anthropogenic global warming, 97.1 
percent endorsed the consensus position that humans were causing 
global warming. 

Basically, if anyone agrees with human activity’s influence on the 
climate, that is a pretty broad definition. 
Policymakers who disagree with the expensive big government 
left wing climate policies might still actually agree with the 97 per-
cent consensus. Scientists who question important elements of cur-
rent climate scientists are included in the number. 
For example, last year, this committee received testimony from 
the climatologist Dr. Roy Spencer. To give you an idea of where he 
stands, Dr. Spencer published a book entitled, ‘‘The Great Global 
Warming Blunder, How Global Warming Hysteria Leads to Bad 
Science, Pandering Politicians and Misguided Policies that Hurt 
the Poor.’’ 

Given his outspoken position on climate policy, Dr. Spencer’s 
comments on the 97 percent statistics are noteworthy. He testified 
‘‘The fact that I believe at least some of recent warming is human 
caused makes me in the 97 percent of researchers who recently 
claimed to support the global warming consensus. The 97 percent 
statement therefore is innocuous since it probably includes all of 
the global skeptics I know who are actively working in the field.’’ 
In short, like the offensive term deniers, the 97 percent statistic 
is a misleading tactic used to marginalize people who are concerned 
about hardworking Americans and impose an all pain, no gain en-
ergy policy that is bad for our Country and will not change the 
global climate. 

I am not a scientist but I am an optometrist. I spent much of my 
life working with the scientific community. I was a zoology major. 
I have said before that there is nothing scientific about discrediting

Politicians aren’t science referees cutting off debate when it suits 
one side and no one has a monopoly on the facts. The bottom line 
is we must ask whether these Obama administration policies are 
worth the lost jobs, lower take home pay, higher gas and electricity 
prices, higher food prices and so on. 

The President once said that his climate policies would make the 
cost of electricity necessarily skyrocket and I believe him. Let us 
remember that the pain will last for decades and falls hardest on 
low income families. We are driving our industries overseas, hurt-
ing American workers and creating foreign factories that emit far 
more than we would. 

I believe in American leadership but we are fooling ourselves if 
we believe that China, Russia, India, Vietnam and so forth are 
going to follow the President’s lead and shut down their power 
plants. 

With that said, I thank our witnesses for being here and look for-
ward to your testimony. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Boozman. 
I will now turn to Senator Gillibrand. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK 
Senator GILLIBRAND. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse, 
for chairing this hearing today on the need to act on climate change 
and for your leadership in the Senate to continue to raise the ur-
gency of this issue. 

Madam Chairwoman, I am deeply grateful for your leadership 
and your continued focus on how important this is for our families 
and our Country. 

Climate change is real, it is here and humans have a role to play 
in it. That much is clear. While it might be easy for some to con-
tinue to deny the existence of climate change, we simply do not 
have that luxury in New York. 

In my State, we are seeing the effects of a changing climate 
every single day. Two and a half years ago, Superstorm Sandy dev-
astated coastal New York as well as New Jersey, Connecticut, 
Rhode Island and its effects were long felt on the entire Atlantic 
coast. 

That was just 2 years after two other devastating storms, Hurri-
cane Irene and tropical storm Lee, which cut a path of destruction 
all across the northeast. These major tropical storms in New York 
over a 2-year period is a huge issue we have to face. 
The storm of the century is simply becoming the storm of the 
year. It is not just the storms themselves that are causing the de-
struction. Sea levels rise and are threatening greater storm surge 
effects, meaning that homes thought to be safe for centuries are 
now at grave risk of flooding. 

Those who deny that climate change is real often talk about the 
potential costs of reducing carbon emissions, but we must weigh 
those costs against the cost of inaction. Inaction on climate change 
will cost the Federal Government and our taxpayers billions and 
billions and billions of dollars.

We have already seen Superstorm Sandy cost more than $60 bil-
lion. In action on climate change also cost homeowners who live in 
coastal communities. Their flood insurance premiums have gone up 
with sea levels rising, it is causing greater flooding and FEMA’s 
flood maps were released a year ago show an expansion of New 
York City’s 100 year flood plain by 15 square miles. That is 45 per-
cent. All of New York City is now having to be contemplated. 
It also has real cost to my State and the people who live there 
when these storms strike. Rebuilding a home or a business is very 
expensive. Suffering the loss of a child or a family member because 
of a storm, you don’t recover from it. These are real costs. These 
have insurmountable losses and effects. 

We have to realize that is the effect of the change in our climate. 
We have to address the issue head on. If we address the issue head 
on, we will save lives, we will lower costs, we will protect families’ 
homes and communities and we will protect businesses. 

We also know for the economy, when we look to reducing our car-
bon emissions, we also gain greater innovation and business oppor-
tunities in clean energy. In fact, a recent report by the Environ-
ment Northeast showed that States that do participate in regional 
greenhouse gas initiatives have seen carbon pollution reduced by 
18 percent and their economies have actually grown by 8.8 percent. 
The report also showed that since the launch of RGGI, New 
York’s electricity prices have actually gone down. They have gone 
down by 6 percent. I am confident that we, this Nation, and some 
of the greatest entrepreneurs and innovators in the world can solve 
this problem and do it in the way that can save all Americans 
costs. 

The real and clear issue with regard to climate change is that it 
is a threat we have to take seriously as a Nation. We cannot wait 
for other countries who are even bigger polluters to take leader-
ship. We cannot wait for them to go first. We have to lead. It is 
who we are. We, as Americans, are always in the forefront of real 
reform and change and great innovation. 

Thank you, Senator Whitehouse, again for holding this hearing. 
It is so important for my State and our Country. It is a great op-
portunity for us to show new creation of jobs and new innovation. 
I think we need to take it head on. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Gillibrand. 
I now turn to our distinguished Ranking Member and my friend, 
Senator Sessions. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF SESSIONS, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA 

Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. 
I know these are important issues to you and you have spent a 
lot of time and effort in mastering these issues. 
I am pleased to have our guests with us, the former EPA Admin-
istrators. We have indeed made a lot of progress in our Country 
since the Environmental Protection Agency was started several 
years ago. We appreciate your leadership in that regard. 
It is great to have Attorney General Luther Strange, my able 
successor as Attorney General of the State of Alabama. Attorney 
Generals have environmental responsibilities for their States.

Dr. Mason, it is great to have you and Dr. Botkin, it is wonderful 
to have you with us. I think it will be a good hearing today. 
We have had some agreement on a number of issues that we 
ought to celebrate. We had agreement at one point, I thought, that 
we would expand nuclear power, which emits no CO2 and other 
pollutants into the atmosphere but we are not making much 
progress there. We have lost four plants in the last few years. A 
fifth is due to close, I believe, in 2019 and only two are under con-
struction. 

How do we get clean energy at a reasonable cost without more 
nuclear power, it seems to me? We have had some agreement on 
ethanol though I wonder now whether my votes or my ideas were 
quite as positive as we thought at the time on ethanol. Good people 
disagree on the wisdom of ethanol. 

We have had some good legislation and maybe some over reach-
ing but some good legislation on efficiency. We can agree on how 
to make our automobiles, our plants and our buildings more energy 
efficient but we are concerned about the dramatic economic costs, 
the costs that would fall on the backs of many of the people sitting 
in our audience today who produce that huge portion of our energy, 
coal, and other energy production that will be adversely impacted 
by the President’s regulations. 

We have to ask some tough questions about that. I think we will. 
It has been mentioned that we have had some storms. I would 
note that hurricane Sandy was not a hurricane. By the time it hit 
shore, it was a tropical storm. We are not seeing increases in hurri-
canes. In fact, it has been 3,100 days since we have had a Category 
3 hurricane in America. That is a remarkable time and maybe one 
of the longest ever. 

IPCC’s fifth climate assessment report released last year said, 
‘‘Current data sets indicate no significant observed trends in global 
tropical cyclone frequency over the past century. Dr. Pilkey testi-
fied here that we don’t have more tornadoes, we don’t have more 
droughts and we don’t have more floods, according to the data he 
has evaluated. 

I just say that it is right and just that members who represent 
the people of the United States, the workers of the United States, 
the people who pay electricity bills and pay their gas bills to go to 
work every day, we represent them too. 

We have to ask ourselves are we doing something to this econ-
omy that is not good for us and how can we make positive gains 
together without damaging our economy. I would note, just for the 
record, that our colleagues need to know that our economy is strug-
gling. We are not doing well. 

Since 2009, median household income has fallen by $2,300. Since 
2009, 7.2 million people have left the work force. Growth in the 
first quarter of this year was negative 1 percent. One out of every 
six men 25 to 54 is not working today. These are statistics that 
ought to cause us concern. 

We have found that many of the regulations are ineffective. The 
United States’ actions which have been improving with CO2 emis-
sions and we are containing the growth of CO2 more than most 
countries in the world, will be insignificant in the total world im-
pact.

I hope that this committee hearing will be positive and we can 
find some common ground and work together but CO2 is not the 
kind of pollutant, Ms. Whitman and gentlemen, that you fought ef-
fectively—NOx, SOx, particulates, and mercury. CO2 is not that 
same kind of pollutant, it just isn’t, and we have to be careful that 
we don’t hammer this economy attempting to achieve something we 
have very little ability to achieve. 
Thank you, Mr.Chairman. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Sessions. 
For our final statement, we have Senator Booker of New Jersey. 
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. COREY BOOKER, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY 

Senator BOOKER. I appreciate this opportunity. I want to thank 
Ranking Member Sessions and Chairman Whitehouse. 

I want to particularly thank you for having the right kind of 
panel assembled here which are Republican Presidential-appointed 
EPA leaders, including my former Governor, who I am proud and 
happy to see today. I hope you got my cell phone message last 
night. 

I am extraordinarily pleased because it clearly says that this is 
not a left-right issue. This is not an issue of politics, this is an 
issue of facts. To have Republican Presidentially appointed EPA 
heads come out, as they did in their joint editorial, and clearly say, 
we have a problem. 

It frustrates me to no end that this is nothing new. When people 
tell the truth of an environmental problem that we have the capac-
ity to do something about, you hear the same story over and over 
again. 

Chairman Whitehouse, I would like to put into the record an ar-
ticle going back and tracing what everyone used to say about what 
would happen to the economy if we did certain things. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. Without objection.

6/15/2014 Will New Climate Regulations Destroy the Economy? (Hint: No.)” Peter H, Gleick
 
Will New Climate Regulations Destroy the Economy? (Hint:
No.)


No. On the contrary, they might just save it by helping stimulate new technologies and industries and by reducing the
risks of climate disruption.

There is a long history of claims that new rules to protect the environment or human health will seriously harm the United States economy. These claims are political fodder, they are provocative. and they are always wrong. in fact, the evidence shows the opposite: environmental regulations consistently produce enormous net benefits to the economy and to human health, In 2008, for example. the United States' environmental technologies and services industry supported 1.7 million jobs. The industry at that time generated approximately $300 billion in revenues and exported goods and services worth $44 billion.

Overall, a peer-reviewed 2011 study found that just the programs established by the 1990 Clean AirAct amendments were
expected to yield direct benefits to the American people that vastly exceed costs of complying with the regulations. The study’s central benefits estimate in 2020 exceeded costs by a factor of more than 30-to-1.

And these partial economic assessments ignore the health benefits of these rules, Health experts have estimated that the 1990
Clean Air Act amendments, for example. for 2010 alone:

Avoided more than 160,000 premature deaths, 130,000 heart attacks (acute myocardial infarction), millions of cases of
respiratory problems such as acute bronchitis and asthma attacks, and 56.000 hospital admissions,

Prevented 13 million lost workdays, improving worker productivity which contributes to a stronger economy.

Kept kids healthy and in school. avoiding 3.2 million lost school days due to respiratory illness and other diseases caused or
exacerbated by air pollution.

Now, as the Obama Administration has proposed rules to cut carbon dioxide emissions in an effort to reduce the growing threats to the nation of climate change, these claims of harm to the economy are being rolled out again. Even before the Obama
Administration's rules were announced, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a report claiming the carbon pollution regulations
would harm the economy. That produced a fast response from the US EPA calling the report "irresponsible speculation." (The
Chamber also opposed the 1990 upgrade of the Clean AirAct and routinely fights other environmental regulations.)

Some polluting industries might suffer. but it is past time to unleash American ingenuity in the name of reducing the devastating threat of climate change,

Just to provide a bit of perspective, here is a graph of the total U.S. gross domestic production (GDP) in 2009 dollars (corrected for inﬂation) along with the regular claims of harm to the economy.


Page 45

6/1822014 Will New Climate Regulations Destroy the Economy? (Hint: No.) | Peter H. Gleick

<See original document for figure>

Claims that environmental laws will destroy the economy have been regularly made and are consistently false. This graph shows U.S. GDP from 1929 to 2013 in real 2009 dollars (corrected for Inflation) along with the years major environmental laws were passed, (Prepared by Peter Gleick, Pacific Institute. GDP data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.)

And for the record. here are some of those past claims (HT to the Cry Wolf Project and others) - proven wrong over and over.
 An October 1990 Wall Street Journal editorial urging; President Bush to veto the 1990 Clean Air Act update claimed "The Clean Air Act's unduly stringent and extremely costly provisions could seriously threaten this nation's economic expansion."

Autoindustry executives,in opposition to the 1990 Clean Air Act update also stated "[Further decreasing auto emissions] is not feasible or necessary and that congressional dictates to do so would be financially ruinous."

in 1975, the US Chamber of Commerce criticized the passage of environmental laws by Congress, including the Clean Air and
Water acts. saying “But they went ahead anyway in the spirit of political expediency to ramrod through measures that would
affect millions of people and billions of dollars..."

The CEO of Pennwalt, a major industrial producer of ozone-depleting CFC‘s talked of "economic chaos" if CFC use was to be phased out.(i) DuPont, the largest CFC manufacturer, warned that "entire industries could fold" if ozone protection legislation was implemented.(2) Again. in January 1990, the DuPont Chemical Company testified to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that accelerating the phase-out of ozone-depleting CFCS to July 1, 1996, would cause "severe economic and social
disruption."

The Mobil Oil Company testified to the House Committee on Energv and Commerce in October 1990 opposing cleaner gasoline standards, saying "The technology to meet these standards [regarding requirements to use a new kind of cleaner gasoline] simply does not exist today...[and we predict] major supply disruptions.”

The National Association of Manufacturers, in opposing, regulations to cut acid rain in 1987, said "The effects [of rules to reduce acid rain} include serious long»term losses in domestic output and employment, heavy cost burdens on manufacturing industries, and a resultant gradual contraction of the entire industrial base. The irony of this bleak scenario is that these economic hardships are borne with no real assurance they would be balanced by a cleaner, healthier environment.

Henry Ford II, in 1966 on regulations addressing seat belt & safety glass mandates, said “We‘ll have to close clown."

We have to address the serious threat of climate change. — let's get on With it and unleash America's ingenuity.

Senator BOOKER. It just shows the upward slant of our economy. 
When the 1972 Clean Water Act came out, everyone said the econ-
omy would be destroyed, it would cost us jobs—quite the contrary, 
our economy increased. It helped to push our economy forward. 
When the Endangered Species Act came out, everyone said the 
economy would be destroyed, it was going to have horrible effects. 
Quite to the contrary, the American economy continued to surge. 
In 1987, the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer, every-
one said, the economy would be destroyed and jobs would be the 
cost. In fact, quite the contrary, when we do stand up, Republicans 
and Democrats, and work together to address real environmental 
issues pointed out not just by scientists, but also by Republican 
presidents, we accomplish great things. 

The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments done under the Bush ad-
ministration—I am happy that Hon. William Reilly is here—which 
addressed our acid rain issues, had tremendous collateral benefits. 
It avoided more than 160,000 premature deaths. The life of human-
ity cannot be quantified numerically but, dear God, the health and 
safety of all residents should be your No. 1 mission. 
It prevented 140,000 heart attacks, acute myocardial infarctions, 
and millions and millions of cases of respiratory problems, acute 
bronchitis and asthma were helped by this Republican and Demo-
crat coalition under a Republican President with a Republican-ap-
pointed EPA head. It prevented 13 million lost work days, improv-
ing worker productivity and kept kids healthy in school, avoiding 
3.2 lost school days. 

This is what we can do when we open and see the facts that Re-
publicans that will talk about today. To me, this is the concern. I 
do not need to reState what Senator Gillibrand said. The actual 
truth is, we are seeing climate change right now. I cannot speak 
to tornadoes, I don’t see any of them in New Jersey, but I can 
speak to the extreme heat problems we are having all across the 
Country which is real, measurable and unequivocal. 
That is causing severe impacts on our Nation and our Nation’s 
economy. I am worried about what is happening in Atlantic City 
with the oceans rising. It is not an opinion, it is a fact and it is 
measurable. We are likely to see on the New Jersey shore the 
ocean rise 1.5 feet by 2050 and 3.5 feet by 2100. 

I am especially concerned about the health concerns. EPA’s regu-
lation of power plants will bring us immediate health benefits. It 
is estimated that in the first year of the new rules taking effect 
that 100,000 asthma attacks and 2,100 heart attacks can be pre-
vented. To me that is real. 

It is unfortunate that marginalized folks, often poor people, are 
the ones who feel the impact of us doing nothing most. African 
American children are twice as likely to be hospitalized for asthma. 
I do not need to see the statistics; I see it in school systems across 
the State of New Jersey. They are four times more likely to die of 
asthma. Latinos are 30 percent more likely to be hospitalized for 
asthma. 

The beautiful thing about this is by doing the right thing, we not 
only will not hurt the economy, but we can actually help to improve 
the economy. If States use these regulations and the opportunity

to make investments, it is estimated we could be seeing upwards 
of $279 billion invested in retrofitting buildings. 
This creates jobs and spurs the economy. These are the kinds of 
jobs that cannot be outsourced. The investment can yield more 
than $1 trillion of energy savings over 10 years. 
I am excited about the opportunity this presents. I feel the ur-
gency when it comes to the health and safety and the long term 
economic well being of our Nation. We must act and we must act 
now. 

I end with the simple conclusion that the choice between action 
that is wise and endorsed by Republican-appointed EPA leaders 
goes to the very evidence that they understand the truth of the 
matter that is true of humanity as well as the United States that 
the only thing necessary for evil to be triumphant is for good peo-
ple to do nothing. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Booker. 
We now have the opportunity to hear from our wonderful panel. 
I will introduce the panel as a group right now and then we will 
go from witness to witness. 

The Honorable William D. Ruckelshaus was the inaugural EPA 
Administrator under President Nixon and was later brought back 
as EPA Administrator under President Reagan. He banned the use 
of the pesticide DDT. 

The Honorable Lee M. Thomas served under President Reagan 
and was instrumental in the negotiation and ratification of the 
Montreal Protocol to phaseout substances that deplete the ozone 
layer. 

Governor Christine Todd Whitman served two terms as Governor 
of New Jersey before serving as EPA Administrator under George 
W. Bush. She oversaw implementation of standards that signifi-
cantly reduced diesel air pollution. 

The Honorable William K. Reilly, EPA Administrator under 
President George H.W. Bush worked to amend the Clean Air Act, 
as already mentioned, to control acid rain. 
Dr. Daniel Botkin is Professor Emeritus of Biology at the Univer-
sity of California, Santa Barbara. 

The Honorable Luther Strange is Alabama’s Attorney General. 
As the former Attorney General of Rhode Island, I particularly wel-
come a colleague here. 

Dr. Joseph R. Mason is the Hermann Moyse Jr./Louisiana Bank-
ers Association Endowed Professor of Banking at Louisiana State 
University and Senior Fellow, The Wharton School. 
I welcome our panel. We will begin with Hon. William Ruckels-
haus.

Several months ago after talking with one another, the four 
former EPA Administrators sitting in front of you found we were 
convinced by the overwhelming verdict of scientists that the earth 
was warming and that we humans were the only controllable con-
tributor to this phenomenon. 

Given those facts, we all signed an op-ed piece that America get 
serious about reducing our contribution to changing the world’s cli-
mate rather than simply sitting back and accepting the avoidable 
consequences. 

If anything, new reports in the last several months have made 
the need to act even more urgent. It is hard to believe that there 
is any question of that. The International Panel on Climate Change 
report validates in the strongest terms the science of climate 
change and projected impacts. 

The National Climate Assessment documents impacts occurring 
here in this Country right now. A report from the CMA Corpora-
tion, made up of retired military officers, highlights the national 
security and military readiness concerns due to climate change. 
We have, as EPA Administrators, served four Presidents over 
four decades. We have successfully wrestled with a variety of public 
health and environmental problems, all contentious, including se-
vere automobile, industrial and air pollution, widespread water pol-
lution and the unacceptable effects of pesticides like DDT. 
We have made progress. We cut our automobile emissions, for ex-
ample, by 95 percent and greatly improved air quality while the 
number of cars has doubled. The hole in the ozone layer and acid 
rain are under control. 

Inherent in all of these problems was uncertain science and pow-
erful economic interests resisting controls. The same is true of cli-
mate change. In all cases cited, the solutions to the problems did 
not result in the predicted economic and social calamity. Scientific 
uncertainty or the inevitable industry resistance does not mean 
that nothing should be done unless we are willing to suffer the con-
sequences of inaction. 

We believe there is legitimate scientific debate over the pace and 
effects of climate change but no legitimate debate over the effect 
of the earth’s warming or man’s contribution. The models of the 
world’s leading scientists predict rising seas, drought, floods, 
wildfires and more severe and frequent storms. Those are the pro-
jections and predictions of these models. 

We are seeing impacts already. Since the ocean absorbs 25–30 
percent of the carbon from stationary or mobile sources, we thought 
the ocean was our friend. It was, keeping significant amounts of 
carbon from the atmosphere. Our friend is paying a penalty. 
The carbon from the burning of fossil fuels is causing the acidity 
of the ocean to rise and is already threatening shellfish, coral reefs 
and other ocean species. The culprit is the same carbon that origi-
nated from fossil fuels that is contributing to planetary warming. 
I was the co-chairman of a committee in my home State of Wash-
ington appointed by the Governor to look at the impacts of ocean 
acidification on Puget Sound which directly threatened the shell-
fish industry in Puget Sound that contributes $275 million a year 
to the State’s economy.

Page 49 

To find out what the nature of the problem was and taking steps 
to both adapt to it and try to reduce the amount of carbon in Puget 
Sound has begun to have some beneficial effect. 

We also know that if America does not get serious about our re-
sponsibility to deal with this problem, nothing much will happen 
in the rest of the world. No action is a choice. It is a choice that 
means we leave to chance the kind of future we want and opt out 
of the solution to a problem that we are a big part of. 

We like to speak of American exceptionalism. If we want to be 
truly exceptional, then we should begin the difficult task of leading 
the world away from the unacceptable effects of our increasing ap-
petites for fossil fuels before it is too late. 
This is an extremely complex problem whose solutions are not 
straightforward. We believe this is no excuse for the complacency 
or not stepping up to our responsibility.

Testimony of William D. Ruckelshaus Before the Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee

Thank you Senators Whitehouse, Sessions and other members of the Subcommittee for convening this hearing on a matter of

Several months ago, after talking with one another, the four former EPA administrators sitting in front of you found we were convinced by the overwhelming verdict of scientists that the earth was warming and that we humans were the only controllable contributor to this phenomenon. Given those facts we all signed an op ed piece that recommended that America get serious about reducing our contribution to changing the world’s climate rather than simply sitting back and accepting the avoidable consequences.

If anything, new reports in the last three months have made the need to act even more urgent. It is hard to believe that there is any question of that.

The IPCC report validates in the strongest terms the science of climate change and the projected impacts.

climate change. In all of the cases cited the solutions to the problems did not result in the predicted economic and social calamity. Scientific uncertainty or the inevitable industry resistance does not mean that nothing should be done unless we are willing to suffer the consequences of inaction.

We believe there is legitimate scientific debate over the pace and effects of climate change but no legitimate debate over the fact of the earth’s warming or over man’s contribution. The models of the world’s leading scientists predict rising seas, drought, floods, wildfires, and more severe and frequent storms. We are seeing impacts already. Since the ocean absorbs 25—30% of the carbon from stationary or mobile sources we thought the ocean was our friend. It was keeping significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. But our friend is paying a penalty. The carbon from the burning of fossil fuels is causing the acidity of the ocean to rise and is already threatening shellfish, coral reefs and other ocean species. The culprit is the same carbon that originated from fossil fuels that is contributing to planetary warming.

We also know that if America does not get serious about our responsibility to deal with this problem nothing much will happen in the rest of the world. Not taking action is a choice. it is a choice that means

Page 52

we leave to chance the kind of future we want, and opt out of the solution to a problem that we are a big part of.

We like to speak of American exceptionalism. If we want to be truly exceptional then we should begin the difficult task of leading the world away from the unacceptable effects of our increasing appetites for fossil fuels before it is too late.

This is an extremely complex problem whose solutions are not straightforward. We believe this is no excuse for complacency or not stepping up to our responsibility.

Responses from William D Ruckelhaus
to questions from U.S. Senate. Committee on Environment and Public Works
July 23, 2014

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse

1. Before many environmental regulations are applied, dire consequences and worst
fear outcomes are usually perpetuated. How did the worst fears and assumptions of
bad outcomes from environmental regulations turn out in reality as the rules were
applied in your own experience?

In my experience when major regulations have been proposed, those opposed to them cite the high
costs of compliance, economic and social, should they be implemented. The
motivation to emphasize and perhaps to exaggerate those costs, is natural.

It is also my experience that when such regulations become final after hearings and extensive comment
n tin-out. the motivation of those affected focus on driving down the costs of compliance
through new technologies and other means

I cannot recall any situation in my tenures when predictions of catastrophic costs
as a result of a regulation ever materialized. 

Senator Jeff Sessions:

1. What do you think should be the role of unclear potter in America’s generating mix?

Nuclear power with its improvement in safely and reduction in costs should play an important role in developing an American Energy policy for the future.


Senator David Vitter:

 

1. Author environmental activist Bill McKibben has written that “you can have a healthy fossil fuel industry or a healthy planet, but you can't have both.” Do you agree with this statement?

 

Page 54

No. This is not an either or situation. As we have seen from other resource and
environmental challenges, there is great potential in new technology that will allow us
responsibly to use such resources even as we move to a low—carbon economy.

Page 55

2. Mr. McKibben has also written that “one way to fight the power of fossil fuel companies is to stop using fossil fuel.” Do you think this is realistic for consumers, in light of the fact that, as the International Energy Agency noted, “Despite all the
attention given to renewable energy, fossil fuels still produce about four-fifths of the energy consumed worldwide?” Moreover, by 2050, the IEA projects that, even with its most aggressive carbon reduction scenario, fossil fuels would still provide 45 percent of global energy demand. Do you agree with this projection? More broadly, do you agree that, even as countries take steps to reduce carbon emissions, fossil fuels will continue to comprise a substantial portion of the global energy mix ill the
coming decades?

I have not done any independent analysis of these projections by the International Energy Agency. It is a highly regarded. independent institution whose research is relied upon by governments and others around the world. Fossil fuels will undoubtedly be in the mix of energy sources in the years ahead. Prudence suggests to me that we should rapidly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels so as to reduce the risks of climatic change.

3. Mr. McKibben has written that a “huge problem with increased reliance on cheap
natural gas: it undercuts the transition to zero—carbon energy sources like solar and
wind power, locking us into long-term reliance on fossil fuels." Do you agree with
this statement? Do you believe that “reliance on cheap natural gas” has been
harmful or helpful to the U.S. economy, particularly for consumers and
manufacturers?

Clearly access to low—cost natural gas has been helpful to the economy. Certainly the use of natural gas, from the perspective of climate change, is better than the use of coal or oil, absent any kind of carbon controls. The larger issue, however, involves the absence of a national energy policy that sets a long—term agenda to reach a low-carbon economy to meet the challenges of a changing climate. We, as a nation. would be far better of with such an energy policy, instead of the ad hoc approach we now take.

4. Activist Naomi Klein wrote that “with the fossil—fuel industry, wrecking the planet is their business model. It’s what they do.” Do you agree with this statement?

No.

5. On November 3, 2013, climate scientists Kerry Emanuel, Tom Wigley, James Hansen, and Ken Caldeira, in an open letter to environmentalists, disputed the notion that world energy demand could be met with 100 percent renewables. Nuclear, they contend, must be part of the equation: “Renewables like wind and solar and biomass will certainly play roles in a future energy economy, but those energy sources cannot scale up fast enough to deliver cheap and reliable power at the scale the global economy requires. While it may be theoretically possible to

Page 56

stabilize the climate without nuclear power, in the real world there is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power.” Do you agree with the authors of this statement?

I agree that in a future low-carbon economy, nuclear power will play an important role. This is especially true given the current absence of storage technology that would address concerns about renewable power generation. 1 note, again, however, that the absence of any comprehensive national energy policy makes achieving our future energy goals more difficult and more expensive.

6. According to Ted Nordhaus and Michael Schellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute, “Whatever their merits as innovation policy, Germany’s enormous solar investments have had little discernible impact on carbon emissions. Germany’s move away from baseload zero~carbon nuclear has resulted in higher coal consumption since 2009. In 2012. Germany’s carbon emissions rose 2 percent. Do you agree with this statement? Do you believe the U.S. should deploy more nuclear instead of relying on renewables to provide baseload power?

I think we should, going forward, push renewables very hard and include nuclear power
in the mix.

7. According to an analysis by the Economist magazine, renewable energy targets in Germany are popular, but their economic consequences are not. As the Economist explained, consumers “increasingly dislike” the “side-effects” of subsidizing
renewable energy. “first, there is the rising cost of electricity. This is a consequence of a renewable-energy law passed in 2000 which guarantees not only 20 years of fixed high prices for solar and wind producers but also preferred access to the electricity grid. As a result, Bavarian roofs now gleam with solar panels and windmills dominate entire landscapes. Last year, the share of renewables in electricity production hit a record 23.4%.”

The Economist explained further, “This subsidy is costly. The difference between the market price for electricity and the higher fixed price for renewables is passed on to the consumers, whose bills have been rising for years. An average household now pays an extra €260 ($355) a year to subsidize renewables: the total cost of renewable subsidies in 2013 was €16 billion. Costs are also going up for companies, making them less competitive than rivals from America, where energy prices are falling thanks to the fracking boom.”

Do you believe that Germany’s renewable energy policies have delivered zero-carbon energy without harming consumers? Do you believe that states, as they attempt to meet EPA’s emissions targets under the proposed Clean Power Plan for existing power plants, can both deploy more renewable energy while doing so without raising the cost of electricity, or imposing higher costs to consumers?

Page 57

We should examine all subsidies granted to energy production and use and determine which are moving us toward lower carbon in the most cost effective way possible.

8. Do you think the U.S. drilling boom, spurred by the technological advance of hydraulic fracturing, coupled with horizontal drilling, has been positive or negative for the U.S. economy, particularly for consumers?

In the short term the United States economy has definitely benefited from hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Developing a sound energy policy also entails looking at potential long-term costs of refusing to factor in the risks of climatic alteration. A careful examination of climate risks will show significant potential environmental and national security costs as well as economic ones.

9. Do you think EPA’s Clean Power Plan will have a meaningful effect on reducing global greenhouse gas concentrations by 2030? Please explain how the Clean Power Plan will prevent rising sea levels, droughts, wildfires, and severe weather.

EPA’s Clean Power Plan will not solve the problem of climate change. No single step will. America must lead or the combination of effective and efficient steps by the world will not materialize

10. Albert Einstein once famously stated that “the right to search for truth implies also a duty; one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be true.” Do you agree with this statement?

I do agree with the Einstein quote. My answers to questions i through ix would be the same as Mr. Reilly‘s as the sources I would rely on would be the same. Therefore I incorporate by reference Bill Reilly’s responses.

11. As you are at least tangentially aware, fossil resources provide the base molecules and products that we need to manufacture virtually everything we use in a modern society. In fact, coal combustion byproducts are what comprise, strengthen and make possible our roads and infrastructure. Chemicals derived from oil and natural gas production are what are refined and manufactured into virtually every product we use today, from computers to our homes, and are what make possible Wind turbines (all components derived, manufactured or refined from fossil fuels) and solar panels (all components derived, manufactured or refined from fossil fuels). Accordingly, many claims about eliminating our use of fossil resources are wholly illusory. However, in order to provide a better understanding of some of your claims regarding our nation’s dependence on these resources, other than counting intermittent electricity generation as a product, please provide a comprehensive list of all the things that are a product or can be manufactured out of sunlight and wind (again, please exclude electricity).

Page 58

The sun. through the process of photosynthesis (see answer to Q. 20), creates directly, and indirectly the food that sustains life on this planet.

The wind. harnessed by early explorers, led to the discovery of much of the Western Hemisphere including America. in the absence of electricity. wind also provided the power to run machinery throughout the world.

12. As EPA Administrator, you acted to ban DDT. Were you ever advised against taking action on banning DDT due to the science on DDT health effects?

The decision was based on balancing the risks of the continued use of DDT against the benefits in the United States. I decided the risks outweighed the benefits — not all agreed.

The reasons for this are spelled out in my decision. (Attachment 1 to this response.)

13. Were you associated with any environmental organization at the time of your decision?

No. and never while at EPA.

14. In what year did you first start fundraising for the Environmental Defense Fund? And how much money in total would you estimate you’ve helped raise for EDF?

I have never raised money for EDF.

15. In 2006 the World Health Organization! lifted the ban on DDT. The toll of the ill-advised ban following EPA’s lead was measured in human lives (millions dead-mostly pregnant women and children under the age of 5), illness (billions sickened) and poverty (more than $1 trillion dollars in lost GDP in sub-Saharan Africa alone). Do you have any regrets for your decision?

My decision, under the terms of the statute I administrated, affected only the United States, where malaria was not an issue. Of course the Congress did not direct me to strike this balance for any other country and i did not.

16. Did you disagree with the WHO‘S decision on DDT? If so, please explain why and what science you use to support your disagreement.

The WHO recommended the use of DDT in 2006 to control malarial mosquitos in those countries where malaria is a problem. As i have said many times, had I been so charged, I would have made the same decision.

17. In your own estimates, how many people have died as a result of your banning of DDT?

Where the decision applied (the US.) none have died to my knowledge.



18. Has the EPA ever made any other decisions on a chemical that resulted in more deaths than your banning of DDT?

See answer to #17.

19. Are you still affiliated with any environmental organization now? If so. which organizations?

I am Chairman Emeritus of the World Resources Institute.

20. Please explain the process of photosynthesis.

New Oxford Dictionary defines photosynthesis as the following:

The process by which green plants and some other organisms use Sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water.

21.How many parts per million (ppm) do humans inhale of C02 when they breathe? How many ppm do humans exhale when they breathe?

I have no data on this question.

22. Of all the “pollutants” regulated by the Clean Air Act and EPA, please provide a list of all those humans exhale at a greater rate than they inhale and at what rate in ppm are they exhaled?

I have no data on this question

23. It has been claimed about you that “it was, of course, then-Environmental Protection Agency administrator William Ruckelshaus who actually banned DDT after ignoring an EPA administrative law judge’s ruling that there was no evidence indicating that DDT posed any sort of threat to human health or the environment. Ruckelshaus never attended any of the agency‘s hearings on DDT. He didn’t read the hearing transcripts and refused to explain his decision.

None of this is surprising given that, in a May 22, 1971 speech before the Wisconsin Audubon Society, Ruckelshaus said that EPA procedures had been streamlined so that DDT could be banned. Ruekelshaus was also a member of — and wrote
fundraising letter for — the EDF”.

Please explain which if any of the above statements you disagree with and why.

(See attachment i) In that decision. as stated, I specifically weighed the risks of the continued use of DDT against the benefits. That‘s what the statue directed me to do. The opinion speaks for itself on this subject. In writing the decision I made extensive use of the transcripts of the earlier hearing before the administrative law judge. I was, in effect,

Page 60

under the statute. acting as an Appellate Judge. It would not have been appropriate for me to sit in while the ALJ was conducting his proceedings.

I sat through the entire two day argument appealed to me as Administrator — consistent with the procedure laid out in the statute. My decision was unanimously affirmed upon appeal to the DC Court of appeals on December 13, l973 as supported by “substantial evidence”. (See attachment ii the Court of Appeals decision).

I have never raised money for EDF or said “EPA procedures had been streamlined so that
DDT could be banned.”

24. Do you believe environmental activists groups should be held liable for false claims
similarly to the way businesses are held accountable for false claims?

Everyone, including members of Congress, should be held accountable for false claims.
Whether this creates legal liability depends on the facts surrounding the claim.

25. Please explain if you disagree with any of these statements and why:

“finally. there is the question of the World Health Organization itself. What’s the WHO been doing for all these years? There are no new facts on DDT ~— all the relevant science about DDT safety has been available since the 1960s. Moreover, the WHO’S strategy of mosquito bed nets and malaria vaccine development has been a dismal failure. While the death toll in malarial regions has mounted, the WHO has been distracted by such dubious issues as whether cell phones and French fries cause cancer. It‘s a relief that the WHO has finally come to its senses, but on the other hand, the organization has done too little, too late. The ranks of the WHO’S leadership need to be purged of those who place the agenda of environmental elitists over the basic survival of the world’s needy.”

i am not familiar with the operations of the WHO so I can’t help you on this question.

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2; l E.A.D. 9

June 2, 1972

PANEL:
[*1]
Before the Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Opinion by William D. Ruckelshaus

OPINION OF THE ADMINISTRATOR

This hearing represents the culmination of approximately three years of intensive administrative inquiry into the uses of DDT. Part I sets forth the background of these proceedings and Part H contains a discussion of the evidence and law and my factual conclusions. I am persuaded for reasons set forth in Part III of this opinion that the long-range risks of continued use of DDT for use on cotton and most other crops is unacceptable and outweighs any benefits. Cancellation for all uses of DDT for crop production and non-health purposes is hereby reaffirmed and will become effective December 31, 1972, in accordance with Part V of this opinion and the accompanying order, except that certain uses, for green peppers, onions, and sweet potatoes in storage may continue on terms and conditions set forth in Part V of this opinion and the accompanying order.

I

A. BACKGROUND

DDT is the familiar abbreviation for the chemical (1,1,1, trichlorophenyl ethane), which was for many years the most widely used chemical pesticide in this country. DDT’s [*2] insecticidal properties were originally discovered, apparently by accident, in 1939, and during World War II it was used extensively for typhus control. Since 1945 DDT has been used for general control of mosquitos, boll weevil infestation in cotton»growing areas, and a variety of other uses. Peak use of DDT occurred at the end of the 1950‘s and present domestic use of DDT in various formulations has been estimated at 6,000 tons per year. n1 According to Admission 7 of the record, approximately 86% or 10,277,258 pounds of domestically used DDT is applied to cotton crops. The same admission indicates that 603,053 pounds and 937,901 pounds, or approximately 5 and 9% of the total formulated by twenty-seven of the petitioners in these hearings are used respectively on soybean and peanut crops. All other uses of the 11,966,196 pounds amount to 158,833 of the total, or little over 1 percent. n2

n1 Admission 6 shows that domestic shipments of DDT by its sole manufacturer, Montrose Chemical Company, totaled 8,827,900 pounds between January 1 and August 1, 1971. Total domestic sales in 1970 were 11,966,196, as stipulated in Admission No. 7. The Examiner found, apparently based on Admission 7, that domestic use in 1970 "was just under 12 million pounds." Exam. Report at 92.

Counsel for the Agency has called to our attention publication of the Department of Agriculture, The Pesticide Review of 1971, which estimates "a domestic disappearance" rate of 25,457 pounds for DDT in 1970. See p. 24. The motion to incorporate this publication is granted, as is the motion by registrants to supplement the record, see infra. I do not believe, however, that the Pesticide Review figure can be accepted, on its face, without further explanation. Since the result I reach today would, if anything, only be reenforced by the higher figure, I see no need to remand. [*3]

n2 Some discrepancy in the figures exists since the figures given in breakdown of use categories total

Page 62

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; l E.A.D. 9

11,977,065 pounds, slightly more than the total sold by the twenty-seven formulators who supplied figures. For the above uses it appears that DDT is sold in four different formulations: emulsifiable sprays; dust; wettable powder; and granular form.

Public concern over the widespread use of pesticides was stirred by Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring, and a natural outgrowth was the investigation of this popular and widely—sprayed chemical. DDT, which for many years had been used with apparent safety, was, the critics alleged, a highly dangerous substance which killed beneficial insects, upset the natural ecological balance, and collected in the food chain, thus posing a hazard to man, and other forms of advanced aquatic and avian life. In 1969 the United States Department of Agriculture commenced a review of the health and environmental hazards attendant to the use of DDT.

Certain uses of DDT were canceled by the Department of Agriculture in 1969 and informal review of remaining uses continued {*4] through 1970. n3 In early 1971 this Agency commenced formal administrative review of DDT registrations by the cancellation of all registrations for DDT products and uses pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (fiFRA) 7 U.S.C. § 135 (1972). n4

n3 PR Notice 69—17. Among the canceled uses were applications to trees for control of Dutch Elm disease, tobacco, home uses, and aquatic uses. 34 Fed Reg. 18827 (1969).

n4 In Environmental Defense Fund v. Ruckelshaus. 439 F.2d 584 (DC. Cir. 1971), the Court of Appeals held that cancellation proceedings should be commenced whenever a registration of a pesticide raises a "substantial question of safety" which warrants further study. On January 15, 1971, all uses of DDT not canceled in 1969 were canceled. PR Notice 71-1. And on March 18, 1971, notices of cancellation were issued for all registered uses of 'I'DE, a DDT metabolite. PR Notice 71-5.

[*5]
B. STATEMENT OF THE CASE
This hearing is the final stage of formal administrative review. n5 Thirty-one registrants have challenged fifteen of the canceled uses of DDT and its metabolite, TDE. n6 These uses of DDT include applications to cotton fields to control the boll weevil and bollworm, applications to various vegetable crops, and a variety of lesser uses in public programs. The case for cancellation has been presented by counsel for the Pesticides Office of the Environmental Protection Agency and attorneys for the Environmental Defense Fund which is an intervenor. Other parties include Eli Lilly & Co, which held a DDT registration for "topocide," a prescription drug, n7 H. P. Cannon & Son, 3 user of DDT, n8 and representatives of the chemical manufacturing industry and various wildlife groups. n9

115 Under fiFRA a registrant is entitled to either a public hearing or a scientific advisory committee or both to
review his registration. Pending completion of that review, a registrant is allowed to continue shipment of his product.

n6 Unless specified, discussion of DDT in this opinion applies to TDE. DDT has three major breakdown products, DDA, DDE, and DDD; separate registrations exist for TDE (DDE). [*6]

n7 There has been some controversy over Eli Lilly's status because it failed to appeal cancellation of its registration within 30 days as required by Section 4(c) of fiFFA. For the purposes of this case I believe they should be accorded status as parties.

n8 There has been some question as to whether or not a "user" has standing to appeal a cancellation and thus seek reinstatement of a canceled use even though no registrant has stepped forward to appeal. The same reasoning employed by the court in Environmental Defense Fund vi Ruckelshaus, supra, and Environmental Defense Fund v. Hardin, 428 F.2d 1093 (I).C. Cir. 1970), which accords standing to ”public interest" groups gives "users" a right to appeal a cancellation.

n9 The groups are: National Agricultural Chemicals Association; National Audubon Society; The Sierra Club; and West Michigan Environmental Action Council. As already noted, the Secretary of Agriculture, in addition to being a party-registrant by virtue of registrations held by its Plant Regulation Division, has appeared as an intervenor.

{*7}
The testimony and exhibits cover in exhaustive fashion all aspects of DDT‘s chemical and toxicological properties. The evidence of record, however, is not so extensive concerning the benefits from using DDT, and most of it has been directed to the major use, which is on cotton crops. n10

Page 63

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, ‘; l E.A.D. 9
n10 "the following uses are involved: for cotton; for military use on clothing; for peppers and pimentos; for fresh market corn; for peanuts; for cabbage, cauliflower, and brussel sprouts; for tomatoes; for lettuce; for potatoes; for sweet potatoes in storage (southern states only); for use in commercial greenhouses and nurseries; for beans (dry, lima, snap); for bat and rodent control; for emergency use for agriculture, health or quarantine purposes; and for onions and garlic; and for lice control. There has been considerable controversy as to what uses were at issue during the hearing. Admission No. 2 sets forth those uses which the Department of Agriculture considers essential. Many of those uses have been canceled and no appeal was taken. The uses at issue in this hearing are only those noted in Admission ll.

[‘8]
The Pesticides Office and Environmental Defense Fund (EDP), in presenting their cases against continued registration for DDT, lean most heavily on evidence which, they contend, establishes: (1) that DDT and its metabolites are toxicants which persist in soil and the aquasphere; (2) that once unleashed, DDT is an uncontrollable chemical which can be transported by leaching, erosion, run-off and volatilization; (3) that DDT is not water-soluble and collects in fat tissue; (4) that organisms tend to collect and concentrate DDT; (5) that these qualities result in accumulations of DDT in wildlife and humans; that once stored or consumed, DDT can be toxic to both animals and humans, and in the case of fish and wildlife inhibit regeneration of species; and (7) that the benefits steming from DDT usage are marginal, given the availability of alternative insecticides and pest management programs, and also the fact that crops produced with DDT are in ample supply. The testimony and exhibits include numerous reports of expert scientists who have described observed effects of DDT in the environment and the laboratory.

Group Petitioners and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [*9] seek to discredit the Agency‘s case by citing the record of safety DDT has compiled throughout the years, and point to the negative findings of epidemiological and human feeding studies carried out over the years on industrial workers and volunteers exposed to concentrated levels of DDT far in excess of that to which the average individual is exposed. Proponents of continued registration have also introduced expert testimony to the effect that DDTs chronic toxicity to man or animals has not been established by adequate proof. The registrants have attacked the assumption that laboratory data, as to effects of exaggerated doses of DDT, can provide a meaningful basis for extrapolating effects on man or the environment. In the alternative, Group Petitioners contend that whatever harm to the environment might be attributed to DDT, it results from misuse and overdosing that occurred in years past. Lastly, Group Petitioners and USDA have attempted to prove that DDT is effective and that its use is more desirable than the organophosphates which are more acutely toxic and costly than DDT.

On April 25, the Hearing Examiner issued an opinion with proposed findings, conclusions and orders [n10] recommending that all “essential" uses of DDT be retained and that cancellation be lifted. [n11] The Examiner‘s report which has findings, conclusions and an opinion, is attached as an appendix. The Examiner apparently accepted in his report the Agency's proof that DDT is a hazard to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife and substitutes exist, He found, as a "matter of fact," DDT can have adverse effects on beneficial animals; that it is transferred through the food chain; that DDT is fat soluble. He concluded, however, as a “matter of law," that DDT is neither a carcinogen nor teratogen, that the particular uses at issue do not adversely affect wildlife, that DDT use has rapidly declined. Examiner's Rept. p. 93.

[n11] There is some confusion as to what the term "essential" means. By Admission number 2 the parties stipulated that certain uses were "essential" in the view of USDA. No stipulation exists that these uses are, in fact, essential in that no alternatives exist or that a shortage of a crop would result without DDT.

The Pesticides Office of this Agency and intervenor Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed exceptions to the Examiner's report, n12 challenging his application of the burden of proof to this case, his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and numerous evidentiary rulings. Exception was also taken to the Examiner’s application of the so—called "risk and benefit" standard of fiFRA.

[n12] Exceptions have also been received in Docket 106, In Re Wallerstein. Stark Bros. Nurseries held a registration for use of DDT on nursery plants. The Examiner recommended cancellation on the grounds that this was not an "essential" use according to USDA.

On May 2, 1972, the Judicial Officer propounded by order, at my direction, a series of questions for briefing and discussion at oral argument, and oral argument was held on May 16. That argument was transcribed and is part of this record. Group Petitioners, USDA, Eli Lilly and HP. Cannon & Sons have also responded to the briefs on exceptions.

A. APPLICABLE LAW

The [‘12] basic fiG scheme has been outlined in court opinions and Agency decisions (see EDF v. EPA, DC, Cir. Slip. Op. 71-1365, fiZd , May 5, 1972) (Opinion of Judge Leventhal); Steam: Elec. Paste Co. v. EPA, 7th Cir. Slip Op. No. 71-1112, F.2d , May 11, 1972; Continental Chemist Co v. EPA, 7th Cir. Slip Op. No. 714828, FZd , May 1 1, 1972; EDF v. Ruckelshaus (Opinion of Judge Bazelon), supra; Statement of Reasons concerning the Registration of Products Containing DDT, 2,4,S-T, and Aldrin/Dieldrin, March 18, 1972; In re Hari-Kari Lindane Pellets, et al., L.F.&R. No. 6 (1971). While there is no need to trace in detail once again the statutory scheme, a brief summary provides a useful prism for filtering the evidence.

1. FIFRA

The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, 7 USC, § 135 (1972), establishes a strict standard for the registration of pesticides. Any "economic poison" which cannot be used without injury to ”man or other vertebrate animals, vegetation, and useful invertebrate animals" is "misbranded", n13 and is therefore subject to cancellation [‘13] n14

n13 Sections 2(2) (2)(c), (d) and (g), respectively provide: The term ‘misbranded' shall apply»

(a) to any economic poison
***

(c) if the labeling accompanying it does not contain directions for use which are necessary and if complied with adequate for the protection of the public;

(d) if the label does not contain a warning or caution statement which may be necessary and if complied with adequate to prevent injury to living man and other vertebrate animals, vegetation, and useful invertebrate animals;

***

(g) if in the case of an insecticide, nematocide, fungicide, or herbicide when used as directed or in accordance with commonly recognized practice it shall be injurious to living man or other vertebrate animals, or vegetation, except weeds, to which it is applied, or to the person applying
such economic poison;

n14 Section 4 permits the Administrator to cancel a registration "if it appears that 'the article and its labeling “ *" do not comply with [the Act]'." Since the Act prohibits distribution of a "misbranded" pesticide, Section 3(a)(5), the registration for a "misbranded" product may be canceled.

1*14}

While the language of the statute, taken literally, requires only a finding of injury to non«target species, the inquiry cannot, however, end with a simplistic application of this plain statutory language. Both judicial and administrative precedent recognize that Congress intended the application of a balancing test, that would measure the risks of using a particular chemical against its benefits. n15 if a product is "misbranded" within the meaning of the Act, 112,, if it bears a label for use that does not meet the criteria of Section 2, it may no longer be shipped in interstate commerce and
stocks in hand in the original package may be seized, 7 U.S.C. § 135(g) (1972)

2. RISKS AND BENEfiTS

It follows from the statutory scheme and this Agency‘s decisions that evidence of each alleged risk must be reviewed and a conclusion reached as to whether or not, and in what degree, such risk is incident to the directed use of a particular product. The task, however, is complicated in the case of a "persistent " pesticide by its possible chronic effects. The degree of persistence, extent of overall usage and mobility all bear on the amplitude or indeed the existence of the risk curve, n16 I believe, however, it is useful to isolate the alleged risks and evaluate each on the

Page 65

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; 1 HAD. 9

assumption that they are unaffected by overall levels of use, and defer to Part IV the discussion of the significance of the relationship between risk and overall use.

n16 Other factors bearing on risk may include the geographical location of application, see, 2g, Statement of Reasons Underlying Registrations for Strychnine, 1080, and Sodium Cyanide, 37 Fed. Reg. 5718 0972), although this may not be as significant where the chemical is highly volatile as is the case with DDT. See also Statement of Reasons Underlying the Cancellation of Mirex, Determination and Order of the Administrator at 7, 32 Fed. Reg. 106 (June 1, 1972).

A. ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE

1. RISKS

a. Health Effects and Environmental Properties. There is no dispute on this record that DDT is a non-specific chemical that kills both target and non-target species in the immediate area of application. Few chemicals, however, are so selective that they can be used without causing some injury to "non-target" species. We must therefore proceed to the evidence bearing on other "risks" and the "benefits" from using DDT.

I am convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that, once used DDT is an uncontrollable, durable chemical that persists in the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Given its insolubility in water and its propensity to be stored in tissues, it collects in the food chain and is passed up to higher forms of aquatic and terrestrial life. There is ample evidence to show that under certain conditions DDT or its metabolites can persist in soil for many years, n17 that it will volatilize or move along with eroding soil. n18 While the degree of transportability is unknown, evidence of record shows that it is occasionally found in remote areas or in ocean species, such as whales, far from any known area of application. ['17]

n17 Method of application and type of soil and climate can affect persistence in soil and likewise run-off into aquatic areas.

n18 Registrants have made much of the fact that aquatic contamination and the spread of DDT have resulted from drift during aerial application. While the Examiner's Report dwells at some length on improved methods of application, it recognizes rim-off as a significant source of aquatic contamination, even with improved aerial spraying techniques.

Persistence and biomagnification in the food chain are, of themselves, a cause for concern, given the unknown and possibly forever undeterminable long-range effects of DDT in man, and the environment. n19 Laboratory tests have, however, produced tumorigenic effects on mice when DDT was fed to them at high levels. n20 Most of the cancer research experts who testified at this hearing indicated that it was their opinion that the turnorigenic results of tests thus far conducted are an indicator of carcinogenity and that DDT should be considered a [* 18] potential carcinogen.
n21

n19 It is particularly difficult to anticipate the long—range effects of exposure to a low dose of a chemical, It may
take many years before adverse effects would take place. Diseases like cancer have an extended latency period.
Mutagenic effects will be apparent only in future generations. Lastly, it may be impossible to relate observed
pathology in man to a particular chemical because of the inability to isolate control groups which are not
exposed in the same degree as the rest of the population.

n20 Tumorigenic effects have been noted in a number of laboratory experiments. The most positive results were
developed by the Bionetics Study and the Lyons and Milan tests. The Bionetics Study of the National Cancer
Institute fed 120 compounds to two strains of mice, DDT was one of 11 compounds to produce an elevated
incidence of tumors. The Lyons and Milan Studies of the International Agency for Research of the World Health
Organization is a multigenerational study (still in progress) of 6,000 mice of in and outbred strains. Increased
hepatomas were noted in male and female mice fed DDT at 250 ppm Metastasis to the lungs or kidneys has
been recorded in five instances. [*19]

n21 Witnesses testifying to the positive correlation between tumorigens and carcinogens were Dr. Umberto
Safftotti, Associate Scientific Director for Carcinogenesis, Etiology Area, National Cancer Institute; Dr. Marvin
Schneidcrman, Associate Chief, Biometry Branch and Associated Director for Demography, National Cancer
Institute; Dr. Samuel Epstein, Senior Research Associate in Pathology, Children's Cancer Research Foundation,

Inc, Boston.

Group Petitioners argue that the testimony is in conﬂict and fasten on to the testimony of the Surgeon General and
that of Drs. Loomis and Butler. The Surgeon General‘s Statement was, however, cautious and, by no means, carries
the burden that the Group Petitioners seek to place on it. In very general terms the Surgeon General stated: “We have
no information on which to indict DDT either as a tumorigen or as a carcinogen for man and on the basis now
available, I cannot conclude DDT represents an imminent health hazard." (Tr. 1350.) This testimony, however, does
not bear on the long-term effects of DDT, nor did the Surgeon General express a view on [*20} what uses, apart from
health uses, would justify continued use of DDT. Indeed, the entire thrust of the Surgeon General's testimony was
only that use for immediate health needs outweighs the possible long—range effects of DDT on human health. Group
Petitioners' other witnesses, Drs. Loomis and Butler, while men of stature in their fields—~toxicology and
pathology--and knowledgeable about cancer treatment and diagnosis, are not specialists in cancer research as is Dr.
Saffiotti. Indeed. Dr. Butler disclaimed such expertise.

Group Petitioners also take refuge under a broad canopy of data--human feeding studies and epidemiological
studies—and support it with the increasingly familiar argument that exposure to any substance in sufficient quantities
may cause cancer.

None of the feeding studies carried out with DDT have been designed adequately to detect carcinogenicity; and given
the latency period of cancer, these studies would have to be carried out for a much longer period. Statistical
population samples for epidemiological studies are also virtually impossible given the latency period for cancer and
the long-term exposure of the general population. Since there is no sharp distinction [*21] between population groups
exposed to low doses and higher doses of DDT, adequate control groups cannot be established. The ”everything is
cancerous argument" falls because it ignores the fact that not all chemicals fed to animals in equally concentrated
doses have produced the same turnorigenic results.

b. Environmental Effects. The case against DDT involves more, however, than a long-range hazard to man's health.
The evidence presented by the Agency's Pesticides Office and the intervenors, EDF, compellingly demonstrates the
adverse impact of DDT on fish and birdlife. Several witnesses testified to first—band observed effects of DDT on fish
and birdlife, reporting lethal or sub-acute effects on aquatic and avian life exposed in DDT—treated areas. Laboratory
evidence is also impressively abundant to show the acute and chronic effects of DDT on avian animal species and
suggest that DDT impairs their reproductive capabilities. n22

n22 See the testimony of Drs. Tarzwell, Nicholson, Philip Butler, Duke, Burdick, Dirnond, Risebrough, Hickey,
and Code.

While the Examiner erroneously excluded testimony as to economic losses caused by DDT‘s contamination of
the aquatic environment--losses to commercial fishermen caused by inability to market contaminated fish-- this
risk is significant, even if it could not he could not be economically quantified. Not all risks can be translated
into dollars and cents, nor can all benefits be assessed in cash terms.

[‘22]
The Petitioner-registrants' assertion that there is no evidence of declining aquatic or avian populations, even if actually
true, is an attempt at confession and avoidance. It does not refute the basic proposition that DDT causes damage to
wildlife species. Group Petitioners‘ argument that DDT is only one toxic substance in a polluted environment, and
thus, whatever its laboratory effects, it cannot be shown to be the causative agent of damage in nature, does not
redeem DDT, but only underscores the magnitude of effort that will be necessary for cleaning up the environment.
Were we forced to isolate in nature, rather than in the laboratory, the effects of various toxic substances, it would be
difficult if not impossible to make a judgment as to the chronic effects of any chemical. As our DDT Statement of
March, 1971, has noted: "Development of adequate testing protocols and facilities is a priority undertaking. But in the
short term, extrapolation from small-scale laboratory analyses must err on the side of safety." See DDT Statement of
Reasons, at 11.

Finally, I am persuaded that a preponderance of the evidence shows that DDE causes thinning of eggshells in certain
bird species. [‘23] The evidence presented included both laboratory data and observational data. Thus, results of
feeding experiments were introduced to show that birds in the laboratory, when fed DDT, produced abnormally thin
eggshells. hi addition, researchers have also correlated thinning of shells by comparing the thickness of eggs found in
nature with that of eggs taken from museums. The museum eggs show little thinning, whereas eggs taken from the
wild after DDT use had become extensive reveal reduced thickness,

Group Petitioners and USDA argue that the laboratory feeding studies, conducted with exaggerated doses ofDDE and
under stress conditions, provide no basis for extrapolating to nature. They suggest that the study results are
contradictory and place particular emphasis on documents which were not part of the original record and the
inconsistencies in Dr. Heath's testimony as brought out during cross-examination. Group Petitioners also contend that

Page 67

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, ‘; l E.A.D. 9
the observed phenomenon of eggshell thinning and DDE residue data are tied by a statistical thread too slender to
connect the two in any meaningful way.
Viewing the evidence as a total picture, a preponderance supports the conclusion that DDE [‘24] does cause eggshell
thinning. Whether or not the laboratory dam above would sustain this conclusion is beside the point. For here there is
laboratory data and observational data, and in addition, a scientific hypothesis, which might explain the phenomenon.
n23

n23 The chief witness introduced to rebut Drs. Risebrough, Hickey and Cade was a graduate student with
limited training in statistical analysis. In view of the credentials of EDF’s witnesses and Hickey, Professor of
Wildlife Ecology at College of Agriculture, University of Wisconsin; Dr. Rosebrough, Associate Ecologist,
University of California at Berkeley; and Dr. Cade, Professor of Zoology at Cornell and Research Director of
Cornell Ornithology Laboratory-J cannot credit this attempt at rebuttal.

The Hearing Examiner apparently resolved the conflict in the evidence by concluding that "there was no
evidence that DDT was the only factor in a decline of bird populations ‘ * *" and that no evidence ”focused its
direct thrust on damage to birds by the uses of DDT that are permitted under the registrations in question.“
Examiner's Report, 70-71. In view of DDTs persistence and mobility, evidence as to the causal effect of these
uses was not required. -

At argument and by motion Group Petitioners have offered additional evidence, some of which bears on the
issue of eggshell thinning. I have granted that motion and considered all that data,

[‘25]

B. Benefits

1. Cotton

I am convinced by the evidence that continued use of DDT is not necessary to insure an adequate supply of cotton at a
reasonable cost. Only 38% of cotton—producing acreage is treated with DDT, although the approximately 10,277,258
pounds used in cotton production is a substantial volume of DDT and accounts for most of its use. The record contains
testimony by witnesses called by registrants and USDA attesting to the efficacy of organophosphate chemicals as
substitutes for DDT and, long-range, the viability of pest management methods, such as the diapause program At
present most areas that use DDT combine it with an organophosphate and toxaphene that use DDT combine it with an
organophosphate and toxaphene in a 42-1 mixture (4 lbs. toxaphene, 2 DDT, 1 methyl parathion). Some areas,
however, according to the testimony, which normally use DDT occasionally apply concentrated methyl parathion in a
4-11). mixture.

There is evidence that organophosphates would not raise costs to the farmer and might, indeed, be cheaper. Any
suggestion that the organophosphates are not economically viable cannot be maintained in face of the undisputed
evidence that [‘26] cotton continues to be tenable crop in Arkansas and Texas where DDT use has declined. n24
There is also testimony in the record to the effect that methyl parathion costs less per application than the
DDT-toxaphene formula. Nor are the testimony and exhibits that show cotton insects develop resistance to
organophosphate chemicals to the point. The very same exhibits make clear that DDT is also subject to resistance. n25

n24 The parties have referred neither in briefs nor argument to testimony or exhibits describing in detail the
economics of cotton production or substitutes. There is general testimony that cotton producers receive a per
bushel subsidy and that this subsidy is the difference between profit and break-even, It is not clear whether or
not breakeven includes a return to the farm owner in terms of salary or return on his investment. While some
evidence suggests that organophosphates are more costly, because of higher price and the need for repeated
applications in concentrated quantities, there is little to suggest that the possible increased variable cost from use
of organophosphates would be a disincentive to producers. Indeed, with subsidies it is not clear what rate of
return a cotton producer receives for invested capital. There was a reference made to an unidentified study
showing that the cost of using substitutes would involve $ 15 million, This figure alone has no meaning. While
later testimony suggests that elimination of DDT would increase variable costs per acre by 5%, this, too, is of
limited significance since the record does not relate it to the support program and the study looked at only a
limited area. [‘27]

n25 I cannot accept the suggestion that we should continue to use DDT until it is good to the very last drop.
Whatever the long-term efficacy of the organophosphates the fact remains that they generally work. While the
fact of insect resistance is important and underscores the need for retaining a variety of chemicals or methods to
manage the same pest problem, this fact does not justify an avoidable use of a harmful chemical.

Page 68

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; 1 BAD. 9

Group Petitioners and USDA, While not disputing the lesser persistence of organophosphates, have stressed their
demonstrated acute toxicity. While they are toxic to beneficial soil insects and non-target species, particularly birds
alighting on treated fields, these organophosphates break down more readily than DDT. They apparently are not
transported in their toxic state to remote areas, unlike DDT which has been found far from treated areas, and
consequently do not pose the same magnitude of risk to the aquasphere. Both testimony and exhibits also demonstrate
that organophosphates are less acutely toxic to aquatic life, although different compounds have different toxicities.
[‘28) The effect of organophosphates on non-target terrestrial life can, unlike the effects of DDT, also be minimized
by prudent use. Application in known nesting areas for rare or extinct birds can be avoided.

2. Other Crop and Produce Uses

The testimony of record, while sparse, shows that registered alternatives, primarily organophosphates, exist for all
other crop and ornamental uses of DDT, except for storage use on sweet potatoes to control weevils, on heavy corn
borer infestations of green peppers, and perhaps onions. n26

n26 Toxaphene and diazinon are registered for control of cutworms but it is not clear from the record as to
whether or not these chemicals are registered or effective to control cutworm infestations on onions. While none
of the parties have pointed to helpful evidence in connection with use for controlling cutworms on onions and
weevils on stored sweet potatoes, I have taken judicial notice of the non-existence of registered alternatives.

3. Non-Crop Use:

In addition to the registrations [*29] for use on crops and in nurseries, several registrations for non-crop uses are also
in issue. Admission ll lists "public health pests--bats and rodents," "Agricultural, Health and Quarantine Treatments
in Emergencies as Recommended by and Under Direction of State-federal Officials" and "fabric treatment" by the
military.

The record is not, unfortunately, well developed as to the scope or method of application for these uses not as to the
overall volume applied for these purposes. While use for bat and mice control is characterized in Admission 11 as a
"public health use," application for these purposes is not supervised by public health officials. The briefs suggest that
use for control of bats and mice is a proprietary use by the military, even though a private pest control operator
testified that use for bats was considered essential by private operators. n27 With respect to "Agricultural and
Quarantine" uses it is difficult to determine to what extent applications are for health purposes or for nuisance
prevention.

n27 The only evidence as to the amount of DDT used for these purposes was given by Col. Fowler, who said
the-total used by the military for bat and mouse control is approximately 800-900 pounds.

[‘30]

With respect to all of these uses, both for public health programs and proprietary use, alternatives do exist. The Public
Health Service testified that DDT is no longer the chemical of choice for controlling disease vectors. As for mice,
warfarin is used effectively, and fumigation and non-chemical means are available for use on bats. Colonel Fowler
testified that the military has not used DDT in this country for two years for mothproofing purposes and stated that he
was aware of alternatives

C. Weight To Be Accorded the Examiner“: Opinion

in reaching the factual conclusions set forth in the preceding sections, 1 have been mindful of Group Petitioners‘
argument, stressed in their briefs and at oral argument, that the Hearing Examiner‘s findings deserve particular
deference in view of his opportunity to resolve contradictions in testimony based on demeanor evidence.

Nowhere does the Examiner state that his conclusions were based on credibility choices. n28 Whatever extra weight,
then, that might be due findings based expressly on a credibility judgment is not appropriate in the case before me.
See, e.g., NLRB v. Dinion Coil Ca, 201 F.2d 484 (2d Cir. 1952) [‘31] where the Examiner‘s report set forth his
assessment of the witnesses' credibility. n29

n28 During oral argument counsel admitted that the Examiner‘s report did not purport to make findings based on
credibility of witnesses, nor could he point to findings which might be explained in light of a credibility contest.
(Transcript of Argument, p. 9698.) The basic questions of fact in this case, the hazard to man and the
environment, were cast and resolved by the Examiner as "conclusions of law."

n29 The precedents, moreover, make clear that the Agency is free to make its own findings and that the
Examiner‘s findings and report only comprise part of the record which a court will then evaluate. FCC v.
Allentown Broadcasting Corp, 349 U.S. 358 (1955); Universal Camara Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474 (1951).

page 69

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; l E.A.D. 9
Even where an Examiner's findings are based on credibility, the Agency may reach a contrary conclusion. See
FCC v. Allentown Broadcasting Corp, supra.

[‘32]
IV
The application of the risk»benefit test to the facts of record is, by no means, simple. We have noted in our Statement
of March 18, 1971, that the variables are numerous. It should also be home in mind that the variables are not static in
point of time. As build-up of a chemical occurs or is detected in the environment, risk increases. Indeed, it may be that
the same tendency of a chemical to persist or build up in the food chain is present but not known about substitute
chemicals. It may also be that circumspect application of a chemical in limited quantities for those uses most
necessary changes the benefit—risk coefficients so as to tilt the scales differently than when we weigh aggregate use for
all purposes against aggregate benefits. See generally EDF v. EPA (Opinion of Judge Leventhal), supra.

A. Burden of Proof

The crux of a cancellation proceeding is the safety of the product when used as directed or in accordance with
"commonly recognized practice." Steam: Phosphorus Paste Co. v. EPA, supra. This, simply stated, means that this
Agency has the burden of going forward to establish those risks which it believes to require cancellation. ['33] n30
In addition, an affirmative aspect of the Agency's case should be the availability of preferable substitute means of
controlling the pests that are controlled by the canceled chemical where the Agency is relying on this fact to establish
that risks outweigh benefits. n31 Evidence showing the availability of a registered chemical or other means of control
which this Agency‘s Pesticides Office is prepared to recommend as a substitute at that point in time, coupled with the
Agency's proof on risk, makes out an affirmative case. n32

n30 The legislative history of fiFRA, judicial decisions and Agency pronouncements all state that the "burden
of proof" remains on the registrant to demonstrate that his product satisfies the requirements for registration
under the Act. See S. Rept. No. 573 at 5 (88th Cong, lst Sess. 1963); H. Rept. No. 1125 at 4 (88th Cong, lst
Sess. 1963); EDP v. EPA, supra; EDF v, Ruckelshaus, supra; Statement of Reasons, March 18, 1971. There
has, unfortunately, been a great deal of misunderstanding concerning these statements. Simply stated, the burden
of proof referred to by the legislative history is the burden of persuasion which requires a party to establish the
existence of primary facts. It should not be confused with the burden of going forward which is generally a rule
to establish the order for the presentation of evidence. The burden of going forward may, however, have
substantive consequences. Where a party which has the burden of going forward fails to satisfy that burden, the
facts will be decided against him, even though the other party may have been responsible for the burden of
persuasion.

While in most legal proceedings the party which has the burden of going forward bears the burden of
persuasion, this is not necessarily the case. On some issues, like contributory negligence in some jurisdictions, it
may be that once one party has introduced evidence to put the issue in the case, the other party bears the burden
of persuasion on that point. In a fiFRA cancellation hearing the proponent of cancellation hears the burden of
going forward, but does not bear the burden of persuasion. [‘34]

1131 While a mere showing of a high degree of risk would make out a prima facie case for cancellation, where
the Agency is relying on the existence of an alternative rather than simply a showing of risk, it should, as here,
present its own witnesses.

n32 This hearing was conducted under rules which have since been amended. (See 37 Fed. Reg. 9476 (May ll,
1972)). Under the Agency‘s former rules registrants proceeded first at the hearing. This order of presentation,
which is now changed, was not prejudicial in this case. The Agency more than discharged its burden to put on a
prima facie case. Registrants had an ample opportunity for rebuttal. At worst this inverted presentation
unnecessarily protracted the hearing.

The burden of rebuttal then falls on registrants or users. They may either seek to negate the proof on risks either by
rebutting the basic scientific data or by showing that a particular use is so limited as not to engender the risks from
widespread use of the chemical. They can also seek to establish aggregate benefits. Where, as here, the existence
[‘35] of alternatives bears on the benefit of the chemical under review they may choose to show non-viability of
alternatives, either for general substitution or in a particular geographical region. n33 They may also seek to show the
non— desirability (or risks) of the alternative if they disagree with the staff judgment of this Agency.

1133 Where there is a generally viable substitute, which will insure an an adequate crop supply, the non- viability

Page 70

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; 1 E.A.D. 9
of the alternative in a particular area will bear on the advisability of a transition period. See Part IV, infia.

B. Application of Risk—Benefit to Crop User of DDT

The Agency and EDF have established that DDT is toxic to nontarget insects and animals, persistent, mobile and
transferable and that it builds up in the food chain. No label directions for use can completely prevent these hazards.
In short, they have established at the very least the risk of the unknown. That risk is compounded where, as is the case
with DDT, man and animals tend to accumulate and store [*36] the chemical. n34 These facts alone constitute risks
that are unjustified where apparently safer alternatives exist to achieve the same benefit. Where, however, there is a
demonstrated laboratory relationship between the chemical and toxic effects in man or animals, this risk is, generally
speaking, rendered even more unacceptable, if alternatives exist. In the case before us the risk to human health from
using DDT cannot be discounted. While these risks might be acceptable were we forced to use DDT, they are not so
trivial that we can be indifferent to assuming them unnecessarily.

n34 In enacting the present law one of the greatest concerns expressed to Congress was the risk of the unknown.
See Statement of Congressman Dingell. Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Departmental Oversight and
Consumer Relations of the House Committee on Agriculture, at 39 (88th Cong, 1st Sess. 1963).

The evidence of record showing storage in man and magnification in the food chain is a warning to the prudent that
man may be exposing [*37] himself to a substance that may ultimately have a serious effect on his health.

As Judge Leventhal recently pointed out, cancer is a "sensitive and fright-laden" matter and noted earlier in his
opinion that carcinogenic effects are "generally cumulative and irreversible when discovered." EDF v. EPA, Slip Op.
at 12 and 16. The possibility that DDT is a carcinogen is at present remote and unquantifiable; but if it is not a siren to
panic, it is a semaphore which suggests that an identifiable public benefit is required to justify continued use of DDT.
Where one chemical tests tumorigenic in a laboratory and one does not, and both accomplish the same task, the latter is
to be preferred, absent some extenuating circumstances.

The risks to the environment from continued use of DDT in massive quantities are more clearly established. There is
no doubt that DDT run—off can cause contamination of waters and given its propensity to volatilize and disperse
during application, there is no assurance that curtailed usage on the order of 12,000,000 pounds per year will not
continue to affect widespread areas beyond the location of application. The Agency staff established, as well, the

[*3 8] existence of acceptable substitutes for all crop uses of DDT except on onions and sweet potatoes in storage and
green peppers.

Registrants attempted but failed to surmount the evidence of established risks and the existence of substitutes by
arguing that the build-up of DDT in the environment and its migration to remote areas has resulted from past uses and
misuses. There is, however, no persuasive evidence of record to show that the aggregate volume of use of DDT for all
uses in question, given the method of application, will not result in continuing dispersal and build-up in the
environment and thus add to or maintain the stress on the environment resulting from past use. The Department of
Agriculture has, for its part, emphasized DDT‘s low acute toxicity in comparison to that of alternative chemicals and
thus tried to make the risk and benefit equation balance out favorably for the continued use of DDT. While the acute
toxicity of methyl parathion must, in the short run, be taken into account, see infra, it does not justify continued use of
DDT on a long-term basis. Where a chemical can be safely used if label directions are followed, a producer cannot
avoid the risk of his [*39] own negligence by exposing third-parties and the environment to a long-term hazard.
Accordingly, all crop uses of DDT are hereby canceled except for application to onions for control of cutworm,
weevils on stored sweet potatoes, and sweet peppers. Shipments of DDT labeled for those uses may continue on terms
set forth in Part V-A. We defer to Part V-B, infra, consideration of the proper timing of cancellation of other uses in
light of the short—run dangers of switching to the use of organophosphates without providing training. n35

n35 Registrants adduced considerable testimony on the effects of organophosphates on non-target species.
Sevin, it appears, is highly toxic to bees and most witnesses agreed that the organophosphates were toxic to non-
target animals, usually birds and insect life, present when a field is sprayed. The present evidence demonstrates,
however, that these organophosphate compounds are less "persistent," and thus do not leach or erode into waters
or collect in the human food chain. While it may be that in time the familiar phrase "familiarity breeds
contempt“ will apply, as we learn more about these compounds, they appear not to present a longrange hazard
to man or aquatic areas. Where registrants have scored, is by demonstrating the acute toxicity of methyl
parathion which is the primary alternative chemical for many of the crop uses in question. That fact does not,
however, alter the long—term balance between the risks and benefits, in View of the non-persistence of the
organophosphates.

[‘40]

C. APPLICATION OF RISK—BENEFIT T0 NON-CROP USES
There remains the question of the disposition on the registered health and government uses and other non~crop uses of
DDT. It should be emphasized that these hearings have never involved the use of DDT by other nations in their health
control programs. As we said in our DDT Statement of March, 1971, "this Agency will not presume to regulate the
felt necessities of other countries." Statement, at 8. Indeed, the FlFRA does not apply to exports. Section 7, 7 USE. §
135 (1972).

Given the alternatives for mothproofing and control of bats and mice-proprietary governmental uses of DDT—I am
persuaded that the benefits are even more de minimal than the risks. On the other hand, public health and quarantine
programs fall into a wholly separate category. See EDF v. Ruckelshaus, 439 F.2d at 594; DDT Statement of Reasons
at ll.

While alternatives also exist for use in public health-quarantine programs and, in most instances, DDT is no longer the
yeoman chemical, I believe that it would be unwise to restrict knowledgeable public officials to the choice of one or
[*41] two chemicals. Like a physician, the public official must have an ample arsenal for the combat of disease and
infestation.

I cannot, however, be indifferent to the fact that the record suggests that "health and quarantine" uses have, in the past,
apparently included proprietary uses by government, Nor can I be complacent about non-supervised use for these
purposes by private citizens. I am, accordingly, requiring a label which will restrain indiscriminate use of DDT for a
wide variety of purposes under the rubric of official use. That label language is set forth in the order accompanying
this opinion, and is designed to restrict shipment of DDT only to U.S. Government officials and State Health
Departments who will be knowledgeable as to the most effective means for control and mindful of the risks of using
DDT. Thus, on an application-by-application basis for necessary health and quarantine purposes, the benefits will be
maximized and outweigh the risks. n36 Cf. 42 U.S.C. § 4332 (1971) which requires an environmental impact
statement on ongoing official programs.

n36 The use of DDT in Topocide, a prescription drug, is regulated by both the Food and Drug Administration
and this Agency. The alternative, Kwell, is a lindane product. I am, however, taking judicial notice of the fact
that lindane registrations are presently under review by this Agency's Pesticides Office and several uses of
lindane have, in the past, been the subject of cancellation proceedings. See In Re Hari Kari Lindane, supra. I am
not prepared to judge on this record whether or not the risk to the environment and the public at large from DDT
shampoo is greater than from lindane shampoo. As for the direct effects on the user of the drug, this matter is for
FDA and the prescribing physician.

[‘42]
V

I turn now to the disposition of these dockets in light of the foregoing principles. At the outset it should be noted that
recent judicial decisions have urged this Agency to use its “flexibility, in both final decisions and suspension orders,
to differentiate between uses of the product" (SeeEDF v. EPA (opinion of Judge Leventhal), supra: at 20), and
reminded us that creative adaptability is the keystone of a workable regulatory process. Cf SEC v. National
Securities, Inc, 393 U.S. 453, 463 (l969). EDT v. EPA, while discussing suspension, serves as a beacon in this
regard, suggesting that registrations be continued selectively, taking into account "restrictions on kinds and extent of
use." Id. at 23. Bearing these principles in mind, I turn first to the form and shape our orders should take.

A. Disposition as to Onions, Stored Sweet Potatoes and Sweet Peppers

There is evidence that DDT is the only useful chemical for controlling heavy corn borer infestations which attack
green peppers in the Del Marva Peninsula. The record shows that about 13,500 pounds of DDT are used regularly as a
ground application for [*43] prophylactic purposes. Sevin, guthion, and phospharnidon can, however, be used at less
than 30% infestation. Del Marva produces less than 5% of the nation's sweet peppers and other crops can be profitably
produced. The Agency staff has conceded in its April 15 brief in support of proposed findings, conclusions and order
that this use of DDT "comes closest—~of all the uses in issue--to being necessary in the sense that no real alternative
insect control method exists under certain conditions." (Brief, at 93 .)

The evidence concerning use of DDT to control cutworms is less clear-cut. Apparently cutworm infestations in the
northwest are sporadic and localized. While it would appear that other chemicals could be used to control cutworm
infestations on onions as with peanuts, none are apparently registered. No party has cited evidence of record showing
what percent of the onion-producing acreage would be affected by a cancellation of DDT.

The evidence with respect to use of DDT as a "dip" to protect stored sweet potatoes against weevil infestation is even
spottier. Neither counsel for the parties not our research has pointed us to evidence of record showing the precise
volume of DDT [*44] use for this purpose, its likely effect on the environment, or the degree of loss that might be

Page 72

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, ‘; 1 BAD. 9
sustained by producers.
While it would be far easier simply to cancel or not cancel the registrations for these uses, I believe that
environmental problems should be parsed with a scalpel, not a hacksaw. While EDF and my own state‘s urge
cancellation, on the ground that producers can easily shit? to producing different crops, there is no evidence as to how
long such transition might require. Moreover, it may be that continued use of a limited volume of DDT in these few
areas, taken in conjunction with aggregate volume of use for other purposes, like health, present no risk to the
environment. Obviously much of the stress on the "global" environment is reduced by curtailing overall volume of
usage and we must then estimate the impact of use, both on the environment as a whole, and the local surroundings.
Lastly, it may well be relevant to examine the impact on overall supply of a commodity. Even though peppers, onions
and sweet potatoes may not be food "staples," it may be that the other acreage is not suited for producing these crops.
In that event, it will be necessary to determine whether [‘45] or not supplies will satisfy demand, and whether or not
a transition period should be fixed to permit a market adjustment. n37

n37 It is a recognized policy of common law nuisance and also of federal environmental legislation to afford
affected producers a transitional period for implementing new requirements.

It follows that additional evidence is required to determine the answers to these questions. In the interim the
cancellation orders will remain in effect, subject to registrants or users petitioning to present additional evidence. In
that event, a stay order will issue pending the determination on remand. If these users or registrants can demonstrate
that a produce shortage will result and their particular use of DDT, taken with other uses, does not create undue stress
on the general or local environment, particularly the aquasphere, cancellation should be lifted. If no produce shortage
will result because other acreage is suitable for these crops, it shall still be open to demonstrate that a transitional
period [‘46] is required for switching to new crops. If the interim use of DDT does not constitute an environmental
risk, final orders of cancellation for these uses will be deferred until the transition can be accomplished, provided
assurances are received at the hearing that formulators and users will not permit bootlegging.

B. The Switch to Methyl Farathion

The need for a transition period arises also in connection with those uses that are being canceled based on the
existence of methyl parathion.

The record before me leaves no doubt that the chief substitute for most uses of DDT, methyl parathion, is highly toxic
chemical and, if misused, is dangerous to applicators. n38 This was the virtually unanimous opinion of all the
witnesses. The introduction into use of organophosphates has, in the past, caused deaths among users who are
untrained in their application and the testimony and exhibits of record point to the unhappy experience of several
years ago where four deaths occurred at the time ethyl parathion began to be used on tobacco crops. Other testimony
noted the increase in nonfatal accidents and attributed almost one»half reported pesticide poisonings to the
organophosphate group. [*47] A survey conducted alter the organophosphates began to replace chlorinated
hydrocarbons in Texas suggests a significantly increased incidence of poisonings.

n38 Not all of the possible substitutes for DDT are equally potent. For example, trichlorofon, monocrotophos,
malathion and carbaryl, among others, are available to control many cotton pests; carbaryl is an all-purpose
chemical for most cotton pests. It is, however, abundantly clear that methyl parathion will be widely used.

That the skilled and trained user may apply organophosphates with complete safety is of comfort only if there is an
orderly transition from DDT to methyl parathion so as to train workers now untutored in the ways of proper use.

I am accordingly making this order effective as of December 31, 1972, insofar as the cancellations of any particular
use is predicated on the availability of methyl parathion as a substitute. In the months that follow the Department of
Agriculture and state extension services and representatives of EPA will have time [*48] to begin educating those
workers who will have to use methyl parathion in future growing seasons. Such a program can also introduce farmers
to the less acutely toxic organophosphates, like carbaryl, which may be satisfactory for many uses.

VI

Far from being inconsistent with the general congressional mandate of F IFRA, a period of adjustment to train users of
methyl parathion or permit a needed transition where no substitutes exist is a logical outgrowth of a sensible
application of risk~benefit analysis. While the legislative history does not address the specific problem before me—-the
tinting of cancellation orders the hearings that preceded the enactment of fiFRA indicate that congressional concern
for safety of the farmer-user of pesticides was no less than Congress’ solicitude for the environment. While Congress
ultimately struck a balance that generally places the risk of negligence on the applicator, see Stearns v. EPA, supra, it
did so in light of assurances that farmers are for their own safety as well as that of the environment being trained in
proper methods of application. See Hearings before the Subcommittee on Departmental Oversight and Consumer

Page 73

1972 EPA App. LEXIS 2, *; 1 E.A.D. 9
Relations [‘49] of the House Committee on Agriculture, supra, at 54, 68. n39

n39 At least two courts have given express recognition to the similarity between the regulatory schemes in
HERA and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: See Welfimi v. Ruckelshaus, 439 F.2d 598 (DC. Cir. 1971); Nor—
Am V. Hardin, 435 F.2d 1133 (7th Cir. 1970) (en band). I believe that the trail Congress intended me to follow is
marked by its directive in Section 348 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 348(f)(3) (1971),
which permits the Secretary to set an effective date for his orders. While similar language has not been expressly
included in fiFRA, its omission can hardly be considered advertant in View of the legislative history. See S.
Rept. No. 573 (881th Cong, 1st Sess. 1963); H. Rept. No. 1125 (88th Cong, 2d Sess. 1964). The purpose of the
1964 amendments was to eliminate registration under protest.

The risk-benefit equation [‘50] is a dynamic one. Timing is a variable in that equation. What may, in the long run, be
necessary to protect the environment could be a short-term threat to human health. This is exactly the case before me
now. The benefits of using organophosphates are a long-range benefit and the risks of DDT result from continued
long. term use. In the very short run, however, the equation balances out very differently. n40 Likewise, the prospect
of dislocation which might ensue were the use of DDT immediately halted where no alternatives exist is a factor we
must reckon with. The major environmental regulatory statutes, enacted and pending, provide "lead time" for an
adjustment to new requirements. n41

n40 I do not believe that the Seventh Circuit's decision in Steam: Phosphorous Paste Co. v. EPA, supra,
precludes me from taking into account the short-term dangers that could result from increased use of methyl
parathion by untrained users. Steam: holds that a product is not "misbranded" simply because it can be highly
dangerous if the user is careless. This reasoning does not, however, compel me to ignore the tendency of human
beings to be negligent where we are dealing with the implementation of an order that will increase use of a
highly dangerous substance Even negligence can be minimized by training. [*51]

n41 While the Examiner excluded from evidence a study of the DDT problem for this Agency undertaken by a
Committee of the National Academy of Sciences, it is appropriate to note that Committee recommended a
phase-out period for the same reasons outlined in this opinion. While I reach my conclusions without relying on
that report's factual findings and recommendations, and base them on the record as compiled below, I believe the
report was erroneously excluded from the record, particularly in view of the offer by counsel for the Agency to
produce a committee member for cross-examination.

While impatience is understandable in view of the past history of delay, we must not be lulled into the belief that
long-standing problems can be corrected by overnight solutions. Today's decision provides a definitive answer to the
status of DDT registrations and all concerned: to this Agency, farmers, manufacturers, the Department of Agriculture,
and extension services; all must proceed with alacrity toward the implementation of this order.

ORDER

In accordance with the foregoing opinion, findings and conclusions of law, use of DDT on cotton, beans (snap, lima,
and dry), peanuts, cabbage, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, tomatoes, fresh market corn, garlic, pimientoes, in
commercial greenhouses, for mothproofing and control of bats and rodents are hereby canceled as of December 31,
1972.

Use of DDT for control of weevils on stored sweet potatoes, green peppers in the De] Marva Peninsula and cutworms
on onions are canceled unless within 30 days users or registrants move to supplement the record in accordance with
Part V of my opinion of today. In such event the order shall be stayed, pending the completion of the record, on terms
and conditions set by the Hearing Examiner, provided that this stay may be dissolved if interested users or registrants
do not present the required evidence in an expeditious fashion. At the conclusion [‘60] of such proceedings, the issue
of cancellation shall be resolved in accordance with my opinion today.
Cancellation for uses of DDT by public health officials in disease control programs and by USDA and the military for
health quarantine and use in prescription drugs is lifted.
In order to implement this decision no DDT shall be shipped in interstate commerce or within the District of
Columbia or any American territory after December 31, 1972, unless its label bears in a prominent fashion in bold
type and capital letters, in a manner satisfactory to the Pesticides Regulation Division, the following language:

(I) FOR USE BY AND DISTRIBUTION TO ONLY U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE OFfiCIALS
OR FOR DISTRIBUTION BY OR ON APPROVAL BY THE U .8. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE TO
OTHER HEALTH SERVICE OFfiCIALS FOR CONTROL OF VECTOR DISEASES; (2) FOR USE
BY AND DISTRIBUTION TO THE USDA OR MILITARY FOR HEALTH QUARANTINE USE; (3)
FOR USE IN THE FORMULATION FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR CONTROLLING BODY
LICE; (4) OR IN DRUG; FOR USE IN CONTROLLING BODY LICE—-TO BE DISPENSED ONLY
BY PHYSICIANS.

USE BY OR DISTRIBUTION TO UNAUTHORIZED USERS OR USE FOR A PURPOSE NOT

SPECIFIED HEREON OR NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH [*61] DIRECTIONS IS DISAPPROVED

BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT: THIS SUBSTANCE IS HARMFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
The Pesticides Regulation Division may require such other language as it considers appropriate.
This label may be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions for shipment for use on green peppers in Del Marva,
cutworms on onions, and weevils on stored sweet potatoes if a stay is in effect.

FNZO, 7 U.SlC. § 135b(c) 0970),

The Administrator's Order is challenged on two grounds: (1) is it based on substantial evidence in the record; (2) does it comply V
the requirements of the National Environnnental Policy Act (NEPA)? For the reasons explicated in Parts 11 and {11 below, to l
questions our answer is affirmative. ll. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATOR’S ORDER

A. The Test

Explicitly established in the substantive legislation are the standards for judicial review. Once the Administrator has made a f:
order concerning the registration of a pesticide, that order is appealable to the United States Court of Appeals. The fiFRA star
directs the Court of Appeals to sustain the findings *1251 "127 of the Administrator with respect to questions of fact if supported
substantial evidence when considered on the record as a whole.’ FN21[ The 1972 amendments further elaborate the scope of judi
review;

FN21.7 U.S.C. § 135b(d) (1970).

The court shall consider all evidence of record. The order of the Administrator shall be sustained if it is supported by substantial
evidence when considered on the record as a whole. [FN22]

FN22. 7 U.S.C. § 136nm (Supp. 11, 1972).

The two versions provide standards of review which are somewhat different, in that the court under the 1970 language need 0
support findings of fact by the Administrator if based on substantial evidence, but the 1972 language requires the court to sup}
orders of the Administrator which are based on substantial evidence. The 1972 amendment was enacted and effective on 21 Oct.
1972, four months after the Administrator issued his Order in question here, but well before our judicial review While the par
seem to assume that the 1970 version is controlling for purposes of our review, [W231 the 1972 statute has no provision denying
application to judicial review of prior orders of the Administrator. We read the 1972 amendment as establishing a standard effect
for judicial review commencing after 21 October 1972, and therefore applicable in the case at bar.

FN23. Brief of Petitioner, Coahoma Chemical Co, at 15; Brief of Petitioner, EDF, at 32.

[1][2] In any event, the provisions for judicial review under both the 1970 and 1972 language clearly require the court to determine
whether the findings of fact of the Administrator are based upon substantial evidence when considered on the record as a whole. Thus
we must apply a traditional type of substantial evidence test, albeit one based on an extraordinarily voluminous record. [FN24]
'Substantial evidence' was long ago defined by Chief Justice Hughes as 'more than a mere scintilla, It means such relevant evidence

a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.‘ Consolidated Edison Co v, NLRB. |FN25l And since the state
requires the whole record to be considered as in Universal Camera Corp, v. NLRB:

The substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight . . . . (This docs not mean
that even as to matters not requiring expertise a court may displace the Board's choice between two fairly conﬂicting views, 0|
though the court would justifiably have made a ditferent choice had the matter been before it de novo. FNZ26

The Supreme Court has more recently recognized in Console v. Federal Maritime Comission that there may be inconsist
conclusions which can be drawn from the same record, each of which may be supported by substantial evidence. Thus, ‘substan
evidence’

is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence (it
not prevent an administrative agency's finding fiom being supported by substantial evidence. FN27l

FN27. 383 U.S. 607 620 86 S.Ct. 1018, 1027, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 {1966}

 

The Supreme Court went on to point out that the substantial evidence test 'frecs the reviewing courts of the time-consuming a
difficult task of weighing the evidence, it gives proper respect to the expertise of the administrative tribunal and it helps promote
uniform *1252 “128 application of the statute.‘ F N281 Other courts have stressed that where questions involve a special expertise
an agency, such as in detailed scientific proceedings, the agency deserves special deference from the courts, although careful revicn
of course always required. [FN28]

FN28. Ibid.

 

In the case at bar our task is made somewhat simpler than the agency's by adhering conscientiously to the proper scope ofjudic
review of administrative action, i.e,, we as a court are confronted with a problem in administrative law, not in chemistry, biolog
medicine, or ecology. It is the administrative agency which has been called upon to hear and evaluate testimony in all scientific ficl
relevant to its ultimate question of permission or prohibition of the sale and use of DDT. The EPA Administrator had an oppomm
to make a careful study of the record of seven months of public hearings and the summaries of evidence prepared for himnj
heard oral argument, and now has arrived at a decision to ban most uses of DDT. It is his decision which we must review; we are r
to make the same decision ourselves We are concerned with how he did it and on how much evidence, Since there is no challenge
procedure here, our problem narrows down to whether his decision is supported by substantial evidence based on the record as
whole

B. The Evidence

Copr. @ West 2004 No Claim to Orig. US Govt, Works

Page 83

A review of the evidence in this case, as summarized by all the briefs, indicates that the situation is as described in Consolo: there
great mass of often inconsistent evidence which was developed at the hearing; this evidence is substantial enOUgh to support
conclusions of the Administrator, although it possibly might support contrary conclusions as well. Considering the evidence in
record as a whole, we cannot say that the Administrator’s decision was not based on substantial evidence, even if the hazardous mat
of DDT ha not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt Sufficient evidence has been adduced to show potentially great dangers fr
DDT, and the Administrator’s decision to cancel the DDT registrations is well within his statutory authority.

Specifically, the Administrator states that DDT is hazardous because of several of its inherent properties: its persistence, mobil
and lipid solubility. IFNSII He contends that the alternatives to DDT do not have such properties, although he concedes that
alternatives may be more acutely toxic in the short run. He presents detailed evidence concerning the human hazards which may ar
from DDT (carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of DDT), and also details the environmental hazards (effects on phytoplanki
beneficial agricultural insects, aquatic invertebrates, fish, and birds). FNJZ! He concludes that an unacceptable risk to man and
environment is posed by continued use of DDT, IFN33[ aside from the few carefully conh’olled uses concerning public health 2
agricultural quarantine purposes, which he permits. ENS-t

These findings and the evidence on which they are based are vigorously challenged by Coahoma and other DDT users. While tr

evidence might be sufficient to have allowed the Administrator to have decided the other way, and permit DDT to continue, th
evidence *1253 "129 is not sufficient to vitiate the actual decision of the Administrator as not having been based on substan
evidence in the record as a whole.

L11 Since the Administrator here decided contrary to the conclusions of the Hearing Examiner, the question arises concerning

proper deference to be given to the Hearing Examiner‘s report. As the Supreme Court indicated in Universal Camera, the bear
examiner's findings and opinion are to be considered as part of the evidence of record, both by the administrator and by the review
court.

We do not require that the examiner‘s findings be given more weight than in reason and in the light of judicial eXperience ti
deserve. The 'substantial evidence' standard is not modified in any way when the Board and its examiner disagree. We intend only
recognize that evidence supporn‘ng a conclusion may be less substantial when an impartial, experienced examiner who has obsen
the wimesses'and lived with the case has drawn conclusions different from the Board's than when he has reached the same conclusi
. . .. The significance of his report, of course, depends largely on the importance of credibility in the particular case. FNSS

Later, in FCC v. Allentown Broadcasting Corp. lFN361 the Court indicated that where responsibility for decision was placed on
Board, it would be inconsistent to require the Board to adopt an examiner's findings unless rejection would be ‘clearly erroneoi
However, the Court did not elaborate on the proper standard to be applied. Subsequently in an opinion by Judge Tamm in Cinderc

Bl Applying the law to the facts at hand, we conclude that the Adrninish'ator has given sufficient weight to the hearing examirt
report. The Administrator reviewed the report of the examiner and the exceptions to the report filed by the EPA staff. He decided
case on the basis of the record developed at the hearings, additional briefs, oral argument, and specially prepared summaries. Jljfi
The case appears to be one where the demeanor of witnesses is not particularly important, and where the examiner himself had
particular expertise, for he was a coal mine accident specialist. F.\ 39} The Administrator could derive a proper appreciation of
effect of cross examination in the case by a reading of the record. Thus we conclude that sufficient weight was given to
examiner's report.

FN38r See note 30, supra.
FN39. Brief of Respondent, Ruckelshaus, at 16.

In another aspect of the question of the substantiality of the evidence, Coahoma, et al., urge that the Administrators findings
insufficient in that they are based to a large extent on data which does not directly and specifically relate to the use of DDT to con
the boll weevil and the bollworm in the cotton growing areas of the Southeast. [FN40 it is true that much of the evidence in
record concerning dangers of DDT *1254 “130 does not specifically relate to this one area or to the use on cotton crops. Ilowev:
is not necessary to have evidence on such a specific use or area in order to be able to conclude on the basis of substantial evidence
the use of DDT in genEIal in hazardous. The Administrator has pointed to evidence in the record showing that use of DDT exce}:
minuscule amounts in highly controlled circumstances should be curtailed because of unreasonable risks to health and
environment. iFNdll Reliance on general data, consideration of laboratory experiments on animals, etcr, provide a sufficient basi

In fact, at least 70% of all DDT is used in the cotton-growing areas, especially the Southeast. Brief of Respond

On the other hand, EDF challenges the Administrator's decision to allow use of DDT in controlling certain public health problem
in agricultural quarantines antines as not being based on substantial evidence. Specifically EDF contends that there is no nee-i
retain these uses of DDT, and that the usual dangers of DDT are present in these particular uses. |EN421 The Administrator finds
these uses may be necessary to combat potential, severe public health problems, and so DDT registrations for these purposes shc
be allowed. The necessity arises from the fact that alternative pesticides are also under EPA review, that situations may arise wl:
the alternatives are not effective, iFN-Ql and that DDT must be available. Because the allowance of continued registration does
mean condoned use, except where certified to be necessary, the Administrator concludes that the benefits of continued registrai
outweigh the risks inherent in such a minuscule use. This View has support in the record as a whole, and thus satisfies the substan
evidence test.

[£1 The entire Order of the Administrator is supported by substantial evidence when the record as a whole is considered. Unds
proper application of the substantial evidence test, as formulated by the Supreme Court and by this Circuit, we affirm

Administrator's Order. We stress again that from an administrative law perspective we simply conclude that the Administrator's Or
is adequately supported by evidence in the record. We do not decide whether we, ourselves, would ban DDT, nor should W6

decide. We have, however, carefully reviewed the decision of the Administrator, and conclude that it should be affirmed.
lll. COMPLIANCE WITH THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT OF 1969

The second challenge to the EPA's action raised by petitioners Coahoma Chemical Co., et al, concerns the failure of EPA to ti
specific report under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). That statute requires that

to the fullest extent possible . , . all agencies of the Federal Government shall , . . include in every recommendation or report
proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human Environment, 3 detai
statement by the responsible official on-- (i) the environmental impact of the proposed action . . ., [FN44l *1255 “131 This has t
interpreted to require an agency to prepare an environmental impact statement whenever the agency's proposed action will hav
significant effect on the environment.

FN-Mt 42 U.S.C. § 433212)}C) (1970),. The statement is required to include consideration of

(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action,

(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,

(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,

(iv) the relationship between local short‘term uses of man‘s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long—ta
productivity, and

(v) any irreversible and irretn'cvable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it
implemented.

Id.

There is little doubt but that the action of EPA in withdrawing DDT registrations will have a substantial effect on the hurt
environment-a indeed, that was the very purpose of the EPA action. The court is asked to consider two other, somewhat interrela
questions concerning NEPA. first, is the EPA an agency subject to the requirements of the statute when it undertakes environmei
actions such as the cancellation of DDT registrations here? Second, has EPA in effect complied with the requirements, despite the l
of a formal NEPA impact statement?

Petitioners Coahoma Chemical Co,, et al., urge that EPA is not exempted from the NEPA requirements. They stress the statut
language requiring ALL agencies to comply, and note that there is no specific language in either NEPA or fiFRA which exem
EPA in this or any other set of circumstances. They note two District Court cases which indicate that all agencies, even
environmental ones, are covered by the NEPA requirements. FN45 Furthermore, they contrast the action of Congress in providin
specific exemption for EPA in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, FN46] with the absence of a provis
in the 1972 fiFRA amendments enacted three days later. [FN471

FNS‘I. As EPA points out, the NEPA objection was only first raised in the briefs to this court; in none of the ear

Our recent decision in Arizona Public Service Co. v. FPC, [FN59 which requires an *1257 “133 agency to at least file a staten

L71 We conclude that where an agency is engaged primarily in an examination of environmental questions, where substantive z
procedural standards ensure hill and adequate consideration of environmentalissucs, then formal compliance with NEPA is
necessary, but fimctional compliance is sufficient. We are not formulating a broad exemption from NEPA for all environmci
agencies or even for all environmentally protective regulatory actions of such agencies. Instead, we delineate a narrow exempt
from the literal requirements for those actions which are undertaken pursuant to sufficient safeguards so that the purpose and polic
behind NEPA will necessarily be fiilfilled, The EPA action here meets this standard, and hence this challenge to the EPA actioi
rejected.

On review of the decision and Order of the EPA Administrator, we find it to be supported by substantial evidence based on the rec

STATEMENT OF CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN, PRESIDENT, THE

OF NEW JERSEY; AND FORMER ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. ENVI-
RONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 

Ms. WHITMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Rank-
ing Member Sessions for holding this hearing and allowing us this 
opportunity. 

I have to begin by expressing my frustration with the discussion 
about whether or not the Environmental Protection Agency has the 
legal authority to regulate carbon emissions that is still taking 
place in some quarters. 

The issue has been settled. EPA does have the authority. The 
law says so, the Supreme Court has said so twice. That matter, I 
believe, should now be put to rest. Given that fact, the agency has 
decided, properly in my view, that it should act now to reduce car-
bon emissions to improve the quality of our air, protect the health 
of our people and as part of an international effort to address glob-
al climate change. 

To the United States, climate change is not just an environ-
mental issue or an economic issue. Climate change also has very 
real implications for our national security. Those concerns must be 
an important part of any discussion that takes place. 

We all know that the earth’s climate is changing. We also know 
that human activity, although not solely responsible and we should 
freely acknowledge that, is both contributing to that change and in-
creasing the risks that we will push the environment beyond the 
point at which we can repair it. 

We should know that when one is contributing to a problem, one 
has an obligation to be a part of the solution of that problem. That 
is what the EPA is trying to do. 

There is, of course, honest disagreement about aspects of the 
agency’s power plant proposal, including whether or not it may be 
stretching its legal authority a bit too far in some parts of the pro-
posed rule. I am sure, however, that EPA will be made aware of 
all concerns during the comment period. 

My hope, however, is that the primary focus will be on the sub-
stance of the proposed rule and not EPA’s broad authority to pro-
mulgate it. That being said, it is clear that the Clean Air Act, as 
it now stands, is an imperfect tool to address the unique challenges 
that climate change presents. congressional action and leadership 
would be a preferable approach, but since Congress has declined to 
act, EPA must. That is the law. Action will not come without cost, 
but since President Nixon created the EPA in 1970, it has sought 
to carry out its mandate in a balanced way. 

Environmental protection and economic prosperity are not mutu-
ally exclusive goals. EPA has not always been able to reach a State 
of perfect equilibrium. I think we will all agree to that. It has, how-
ever, consistently struck a reasonable balance that protects both 
the health of the environment and the health of the economy. 
From 1980 to 2012, the total emissions in the United States of 
six common air pollutants dropped 67 percent. At the same time,

our population grew by 38 percent. Our energy consumption in-
creased by 27 percent and our GDP more than doubled in constant 
dollars. 

More people consuming more energy emitted much less pollution 
without sacrificing economic growth. That is clear evidence of the 
balance that EPA has been able to strike in the past. If the past 
is prologue, further reductions are both achievable and affordable. 
Mr. Chairman, my hope is that Congress will at long last ac-
knowledge that climate change is real, that humans are contrib-
uting to it, and that the potential consequences of inaction are far 
greater than the projected costs of action. 

We have specific and scientific consensus on this issue. What we 
need is political consensus. The two parties were able to rally 
around a common purpose in the early days of the modern environ-
mental policymaking. It is urgent that they do so again. 
Thank you very much.

Statement of the Honorable Christine Todd Whitman before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Washington, D.C.

June 18, 2014

Thank you, Mr. Chairman [Whitehouse] and Ranking Member Sessions for
the opportunity to appear before you this morning. it has been some time since 1
have appeared before a Senate committee. It's good to be with you.

I must begin by expressing my frustration that the discussion about whether
the Environmental Protection Agency has the legal authority to regulate carbon
emissions is still taking place, in some quarters.

The issue has been settled. EPA does have the authority. The law says so and
the Supreme Court has said so twice. The matter should be put to rest.

Given that fact, the Agency has decided — properly, in my view — that it should
act now to reduce carbon emissions to improve the quality of our air, protect the
health of our people, and as part of an international effort to address global Climate
change,

For the United States, climate change is not just an environmental issue or an
economic issue. Climate change also has very real implications for our national
security, and those concerns must be an important part of the discussion.

We all know, after all, that the earth‘s climate is changing. We also know that
human activity, although not solely responsible, as we should freely acknowledge, is
both contributing to that change and increasing the risk that we will push the
environment beyond the point at which we can repair it. And we should know that
when one is contributing to a problem one has an obligation to contribute to its
solution. That’s what the EPA is trying to do.

There is, of course, honest disagreement about aspects of the Agency's power
plant proposal, including whether it may be stretching its legal authority a bit too far
in some parts of the proposed rule. I’m sure, however, that EPA will be made aware
of any and all concerns during the comment period. But I hope the primary focus
will be on the substance of the proposed rule, and not EPA's broad authority to
promulgate it.

Page 91

That being said, it's clear that the Clean Air Act, as it now stands, is an
imperfect tool to address the unique challenges that climate change presents.
Congressional action and leadership would be a preferable approach. But since
Congress has declined to act, the EPA must.

Action will not come without cost. But since President Nixon created the EPA
in 1970, it has sought to carry out its mandate in a balanced way. Environmental
protection and economic prosperity are not mutually exclusive goals.

EPA has not always been able to reach a state of perfect equilibrium. it has,
however, consistently struck a reasonable balance that protects both the health of
the environment and the health of our economy.

To illustrate, from 1,980 to 2012, the total emissions in the United States of
six common air pollutants dropped by 67 percent. At the same time, our population
grew by 38 percent, our energy consumption increased by 27 percent, and our GDP
more than doubled, in constant dollars.

So more people, consuming more energy, emitted much less pollution
without sacrificing economic growth. That is clear evidence of the balance the EPA
has struck.

If the past is prologue, further reductions are achievable and affordable.

Mr. Chairman, my hope is that Congress will, at long last, acknowledge that
climate change is real, that humans are contributing to it, and that the potential
consequences of inaction are far greater than the projected costs of action.

We have a scientific consensus around this issue. We also need a political
consensus.

The two parties were able to rally around a common purpose in the early
days of modern environmental policymaking it is urgent that they do so again.

Thank you.

The Climate ls Changing. Republicans Need to Open Their Eye... Page 1 of 5

POLITICO/MAGAZINE

    
IN THE ARENA
The Climate Is Changing. Republicans
Need to Open Their Eyes Before It’s Too Late.

By CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN ‘ May 14, 2014

This week, two teams of scientists announced that the West Antarctic ice sheet has begun collapsing, beginning what they call an “unstoppable” process that could raise sea levels by as much as 15 feet over time. “This is really happening,” Thomas P. Wagner, one of the researchers, told the New York Times. “There’s nothing to stop it now.” The timing was especially unfortunate for Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican senator and 2016 hopeful, who had just cast doubt on

Page 93

The Climate ls Changing. Republicans Need to Open Their Eye... Page 2 of 5

the phenomenon of human—induced climate change, telling ABC News, “I do not believe that human activity is causing these
dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it.”

Rubio has expressed more reasonable positions on the topic in the past—and he quickly sought to clarify his remarks~but I do not
entirely blame him for his rhetorical shift. In an annual Pew poll,
only 14 percent of Republicans cited climate change as a top policy
priority. That’s down from 23 percent in 2007, the first year Pew
included climate change in its priority list. The party has clearly
changed in those seven years, and Rubio knows where his voting
base for 2016 is on the issue.

This is not simply a problem in the Republican Party, though. The
American public routinely ranks addressing climate change low on
its list of priorities for Washington. This year it ranked 19th among
20 issues tested by Pew, just behind “dealing with moral
breakdown" and “improving roads, bridges, public transit."

The climate issue is politically challenging not only because it’s at
the bottom of people’s priority lists, but also because of overreach on
both sides of the debate. Humans aren’t the sole “cause” of climate
change, and environmentalists have done a disservice in making
that claim too assertively. Our activities are exacerbating natural
phenomena, making us part of the problem, but the Earth and its
climate has been changing since it was formed. Because of human 
activity, things are changing faster than nature or humans can


Page 94


adapt, and the sooner we start taking steps to slow things, the better
off we will be.

The modern environmental movement arguably began with Teddy
Roosevelt, the Republican president who established the national
park system. A Republican president, Richard Nixon, and a
Democratic Congress created much of our landmark environmental
legislation, including the Clean Air Act and the establishment of the
Environmental Protection Agency. But Republicans have gotten
away from those values in recent years. The only way to return the
GOP to its roots and, in turn, make headway on climate change is by
ensuring that Republicans and all Americans—recognize the very
real economic costs of not protecting our environment.

Scientists have long predicted that one of the consequences of
climate change will be more frequent and more severe storms. They
can’t predict where and when they will occur, but the extreme
magnitude of them reflects climate change. We saw the destruction
wrought by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and I do not want anyone to
have to endure what citizens of the New Jersey and New York
coastlines experienced in that storm. Taking just my home state as
an example, New Jersey‘s 127 miles of sandy beaches contribute
approximately $20 billion in economic activity to New Jersey’s
economy. More frequent and more severe storms means more
homes and businesses destroyed, state economies blighted and of
course, most importantly, more lives lost. We simply cannot afford
to let that happen.

Page 95

And the climate’s not the only thing at stake here. Recent studies
linking various health and economic impacts of environmental
contamination should be enough to give any policymaker pause: the
connection between certain pesticides and Parkinson’s, the
correlation between elevated lead in gasoline with crime rates and
the finding that pregnant women who were exposed to high levels of
diesel particulates were twice as likely to have an autistic child. In
our necessary mission to grow the economy, we cannot neglect
environmental stewardship; the price we pay is much greater than
we can afford, both in terms of dollars and human lives.

This is no zero-sum game. In fact, the more our economy grows, the
better we ought to be able to protect the planet—and ourselves.
Recently economists have hypothesized what is called the
“environmental Kuznets curve," which shows that after a certain
point in a country’s development, GDP continues to grow even as
the level of environmental pollutants decreases. To use just one
example, between 1970 and 2006, U.S. GDP grew by 195 percent,
yet thanks to regulatory changes annual emissions of carbon
monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead all decreased significantly.

I remain confident that economic prosperity and environmental
protection are not mutually exclusive goals, and as soon as my party
recognizes the exorbitant economic costs of not acting on climate
change, I believe we will start to make progress. It is imperative that
Congress make this issue a priority. I only hope it’s not already too
late.

Environment and Public Works Committee Hearing
June 18, 2014

Follow-up Questions for Written Submission

Questions for Whitman

Questions from:
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse

1. Before many environmental regulations are applied, dire consequences and worst fear
outcomes are usually perpetuated. How did the worst fears and assumptions of bad
outcomes from environmental regulations turn out in reality as the rules were applied in
your own experience?

As i indicated in my testimony, environmental protection and economic growth can go hand
in hand. From 1980 to 2012, the total emissions in the United States of six common air
pollutants dropped by 67 percent. At the same time, our population grew by 38 percent,
our energy consumption increased by 27 percent, and our GDP more than doubled, in
constant dollars. As I mentioned at the hearing, one example during my tenure was the
regulation of diesel non-road engines. When we began the regulatory process, industry
complained that they couldn’t possibly meet the new, cleaner engine standards in the
timeframe proposed and that it would be very costly. As the process proceeded, one
company eventually came forward and said they could meet the new standards within the
timeframe. As the regulations went into effect, all of the companies were able to comply
without dire consequences, and significant clean air benefits have been achieved.

EPA has compiled on their website the costs and benefits of the various Clean Air Act
regulations at: http://www.epa.gov/cleanairactbenefits/economy.html

Questions from:
Senator Cory Booker
1. Governor Whitman, I appreciated your opening comments which recognized that 
environmental protection and economic prosperity are not mutually exclusive goals. Since
2009, the nine states participating in the regional cap-and-trade program known as RGGI

Page 98

have cut emissions by 18 percent, while their economies grew by nearly 9 percent during
that time period. I believe that New Jersey should re~join RGGI.

a. In light of the proposed new EPA power plant regulation which would give flexibility
to states in how to reduce emissions, do you believe that New Jersey should now
consider re-joining RGGI?

I will leave that decision to Gov. Christie.

2. From my research it seems that New Jersey is particularly vulnerable to the effects of
climate change. Not only are sea levels off the Jersey Coast expected to rise more than the
global average in coming years, but our coast is also slowly sinking over time. All of this
adds up to potentially catastrophic future flooding.

a. Is this consistent with your understanding of the threat climate change poses to New Jersey?

I would agree that, with 127 miles of beach front, New Jersey is certainly at
significant risk from sea level rise, but l'm not sure that it is more or less vulnerable

than other coastal states.

3. Governor Whitman, nationally we get about 20 percent of our electricity from nuclear
energy. But in New Jersey we get nearly 50% of our electricity from nuclear. As a carbon free source of base load power, do you see more nuclear energy as part
of the solution towards significant emissions reductions?

Yes
Questions from:

Senator David Vitter

1. Author and environmental activist Bill McKibben has written that “You can have a healthy
fossil-fuel industry or a healthy planet, but you can’t have both.”

Do you agree with this statement?

No. This is not an either/or situation. As we have seen from other resource and
environmental challenges, there is great potential in new technology that will allow us
to use responsibly such resources even as we move to a low~carbon economy.

2. Mr. McKibben has also written that ”one way to fight the power of fossil fuel companies] is to
stop using fossil fuel."

Page 99

Do you think this is realistic for consumers, in light of the fact that, as the International
Energy Agency noted, “Despite all the attention given to renewable energy, fossil fuels
still produce about four—fifths of the energy consumed worldwide?" Moreover, by 2050,
the IEA projects that, even with its most aggressive carbon reduction scenario, fossil
fuels would still provide 45 percent of global energy demand. Do you agree with this
projection? More broadly, do you agree that, even as countries take steps to reduce
carbon emissions, fossil fuels will continue to comprise a substantial portion of the
global energy mix in the coming decades?

I agree that fossil fuels make up a substantial part of our energy mix and will continue to
do so for some time. My hope is that we can migrate to cleaner sources of power over
time, such a nuclear power and renewable energy, and can increase our efforts at
conservation and efficiency. Within the fossil fuels, natural gas is cleaner than coal and
can be an important fuel, particularly in the nearer term, and hopefully we can
transition to cleaner coal as the technology becomes available/affordable.

3. Mr. McKibben has written that a "huge problem with increased reliance on cheap natural gas: it
undercuts that transition to zero-carbon energy sources like solar and wind power, locking us
into long»term reliance on fossil fuels."

Do you agree with this statement? Do you believe that "reliance on cheap natural gas"
has been harmful or helpful to the U.S. economy, particularly for consumers and manufacturers?

I do not agree; I do not think it is an either/or proposition. We can use more natural gas
while also increasing our use of renewables, Overall, natural gas has been helpful to our
country since much of it is domestically produced, and it has allowed for the reduction
in coal use. We need to be careful not to over-invest in natural gas as an electricity
source, however, because of its price volatility. We also need to be careful that the gas
is obtained in a safe and environmentally protective manner. This is why i agreed to
serve on the Board of the Center for Sustainable Shale Development (CSSD), a
collaboration built on constructive engagement among environmental organizations,
philanthropic foundations, and energy companies in the Appalachian Basin working to
develop rigorous performance standards for sustainable shale development.

The larger issue, however, involves the absence of any national energy policy that sets a
long-term agenda to reach a low-carbon economy to meet the challenges of a changing
climate. We, as a nation, would be far better off with such an energy policy, instead of
the ad hoc approach we now take.

Page 100

4. Activist Naomi Klein wrote that "with the fossil fuel industry, wrecking the planet is their
business model. It’s what they Do."

Do you agree with this statement?

No

5. On November 3, 2013, climate scientists Kerry Emanuel, Tom Wigley, James Hansen, and Ken
Caldeira, in an open letter to environmentalists, disputed the notion that world energy demand
could be met with 100 percent renewables, Nuclear, they contend, must be part of the
equation: ”Renewables like wind and solar and biomass will certainly play roles in a future
energy economy, but those energy sources cannot scale up fast enough to deliver cheap and
reliable power at the scale the global economy requires. While it may be theoretically possible
to stabilize the climate without nuclear power, in the real world there is no credible path to
climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power."

Do you agree with the authors of this statement?

Yes

6. According to Ted Nordhaus and Michael Schellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute,
"Whatever their merits as innovation policy, Germany’s enormous solar investments have had
little discernible impact on carbon emissions. Germany's move away from baseload zero-carbon
nuclear has resulted in higher coal consumption since 2009. In 2012, Germany's carbon emissions rose 2 percent."

Do you agree with this statement? Do you believe the U.S. should deploy more nuclear
instead of relying on renewables to provide baseload power?

I agree with the statement from the Breakthrough Institute. 1 do not believe, however,
that nuclear and renewables are an either/or proposition. | support increasing our use
of nuclear power while also expanding our use of renewables. Most renewables, like
wind and solar, are not baseload power, however, and require backup power.

7. According to an analysis by the Economist magazine, renewable energy targets in Germany are
popular, but their economic consequences are not. As the Economist explained, consumers
"increasingly dislike” the ”side-effects” of subsidizing renewable energy. ”first, there is the
rising cost of electricity. This is a consequence of a renewable—energy law passed in 2000 which
guarantees not only 20 years of fixed high prices for solar and wind producers but also preferred
access to the electricity grid. As a result, Bavarian roofs now gleam with solar panels and
windmills dominate entire landscapes. Last year, the share of renewables in electricity
production hit a record 23.4%."


Page 101

The Economist explained further, “This subsidy is costly. The difference between the market
price for electricity and the higher fixed price for renewables is passed on to consumers, whose
bills have been rising for years. An average household now pays an extra €260 ($355) a year to
subsidize renewables: the total cost of renewable subsidies in 2013 was €16 billion. Costs are
also going up for companies, making them less competitive than rivals from America, where
energy prices are falling thanks to the fracking boom.”

Do you believe that Germany’s renewable energy policies have delivered zero-carbon
energy without harming consumers? Do you believe that states, as they attempt to
meet EPA’s emissions targets under the proposed Clean Power Plan for existing power
plants, can both deploy more renewable energy while doing so without raising the cost
of electricity, or imposing higher costs on consumers?

I agree that renewable energy can be costly. I will defer to the states on how they will
comply with the Clean Power Plan, but in general I believe we need an “all of the above"
strategy to meet our energy needs while also working to reduce emissions.

8. Do you think the U.S. drilling boom, spurred by the technological advance of hydraulic
fracturing, coupled with horizontal drilling, has been positive or negative for the U.S. economy,
particularly for consumers?

I believe it has been a net positive since it is a domestically-sourced fuel and it has allowed for us
to reduce our coal use. On the other hand, natural gas is subject to price spikes so I believe we
need to be careful not to over-invest in natural gas plants as an electricity source. Also, we
must be sure that the natural gas is extracted safely, in an environmentally protective way. That
is one of the reasons I’ve agreed to serve on the Board of the Center for Sustainable Shale
Development, (CSSD), a collaboration built on constructive engagement among environmental
organizations, philanthropic foundations, and energy companies in the Appalachian Basin
working to develop rigorous performance standards for sustainable shale development.

9. Do you think EPA’s Clean Power Plan will have a meaningful effect on reducing global
greenhouse gas concentrations by 2030? Please explain how the Clean Power Plan will prevent
rising sea levels, droughts, wildfires, and severe weather.

I will defer to the EPA to defend their plan and to explain its results. I do believe, however, that
it is important for our country to take meaningful action on climate change and to show
leadership on the issue if we are going to get the rest of the world to take action also.

10. As you are at least tangentially aware, fossil resources provide the base molecules and products
that we need to manufacture virtually everything we use in a modern society. In fact, coal
combustion byproducts are what comprise, strengthen and make possible our roads and
infrastructure. Chemicals derived from oil and natural gas production are what are refined and


Page 102

manufactured into virtually every product we use today, from computers to our homes, and are
what make possible wind turbines (all components derived, manufactured or refined from fossil
fuels). Accordingly, many claims about eliminating our use of fossil resources are wholly illusory.
However, in order to provide a better understanding of some of your claims regarding our
nation’s dependence on these resources, other than counting intermittent electricity
generations as a product, please provide a comprehensive list of all the things that are a product
or can be manufactured out of sunlight and wind (again please exclude electricity).

I am not sure what you mean by my claims regarding our nation’s dependence on these
resources.” i agree with you that we cannot eliminate the fossil fuel industry. I am not aware of
products manufactured out of sunlight or wind other than electricity, although sunlight is obviously integral to industries involved in food production, lumber, etc.

11. The new NAAQS standard for Pit/12.5 was established in December 2012. Why would EPA
purposely ignore the impact of the new standards on continuing reductions?

I would defer to EPA for a response to this question. This standard was established nearly 10
years after my departure from the agency.

12. Based on EPA’s airtrends data, PMZLS concentrations have been reduced by 33% from Year
2000 to Year 2012, and the trend is for further reductions under the new regulations. Given
this, how and why are “co-benefits” of the GHG NSPS justified?

Again, I would defer to EPA for information pertaining to the GHG NSPS.

13. There are serious problems with the science underpinning the PM2.5 standards. The key
participants (Beale, Brenner, Wegman) were employed during your tenure at EPA,

a) Were you ever briefed by any of these individuals?

b) Did you ever review the work of these individuals?

c) Were you ever made aware of the problems with the data?

d) What regulations were developed or promulgated during your tenure that were
justified based on this data?

a. Yes

b. No. None of these individuals reported to me so I did not review their work.
c. No

d. None that I am aware of,

14. Do you believe it is appropriate for the American public to trust EPA on any regulation that relies upon “secret science”?

Page 103

i believe EPA should use the best science available when developing regulations.

15. Please explain what constitutes a violation of the information Quality Act.

i will defer to the legal experts as to what constitutes a violation of this law. OMB guidance on
the Act can be found here:
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_agency_info_quality_links

16. Please explain what constitutes a violation of the Data Access Act.

i will defer to the legal experts as to what constitutes a violation of the Data Access Act. The
OMB Circular on this issue can be found here: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-10-08/html/99-26264.htm


17. On December 4, 2001, you were advised by Dr. John Graham, OIRA:

Based on our reviews of EPA’s recent rulemakings on air pollution and the agency’s 2001 Regulatory
Plan, it is clear that we need to understand better which sources of PM in our economy are
responsible for the PM-related health effects. As the present time, there is no scientific consensus
about what toxicity values are appropriate for specific types of particles and, as a result, EPA has
adopted a default position in past regulatory analyses that all particles are equally toxic. However,
there is emerging evidence that some types affine particles may pose a greater health risk. The
more recent multi—city studies suggest that PM appears to be more harmful in some cities than
others, variation that may be attributable to the different kinds of particles found in different cities.
Studies vary in their findings about which sources of PM are most strongly related to mortality,
identifying a variety of sources from coal combustion and oil burning to the emissions from motor
vehicles.

If research can identify those particles most responsible for health risks, it may be possible to
design controls that do more for public health and cost the economy less than would occur
through policies that assume all particles are equally toxic. Given the tens of billions of dollars of
social costs that will be devoted to PM emissions over the next 20 years, this follow—up research
should begin without delay in FY 2002.

On March 12, 2002, you responded by indicating that EPA was proceeding with more research.
What were the results of that research while you were at EPA?

I am not aware of any outcomes from the research conducted that year. i left EPA in June 2003.

18. In April 2006 OlRA sent a letter to Admin Johnston (sic) indicating that there were still serious
concerns about the ability of EPA to properly differentiate between the effects of PM2.S and


Page 104

PMlO. Are you aware of any progress in addressing the OIRA concerns about the data and
modeling used by EPA?

No

The ozone concentrations have been reduced 14% from 1990 to 2012 and 9% from 2000 to
2012. The national average is now below the EPA standard. How can EPA justify "co-benefits"
of the GHG NSPS rule? And why has EPA not provided a baseline projection of the ozone levels?

i will defer to EPA to answer questions related to their proposed rule.

EPA is well aware that indoor air is a major factor in asthma incidents. How do you account for
this effect in your views on the NSPS?

I will defer to EPA to answer questions about their proposal. As you know, the rule is a proposal
at this point and is likely to change following the comment period.

21. The Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) was
adopted by EPA to estimate the impacts of C02 reduction policies. Was this model was in use
during your tenure? If the model showed negligible temperature and sea level rise as a result of
a proposal, how should EPA respond? Why didn’t EPA present this analysis in the RIA for the
GHG NSPS?

I do not know whether that model was used in my tenure. I will defer to EPA to answer
questions related to the appropriate use of this model and their GHG NSPS proposal.

22. EPA has used an approach to estimate the impact of loss of discretionary income on premature
death among the elderly. Was this analysis ever used during your tenure at EPA? Why weren’t

these results reported in the GHG RlA?

I do not know if this approach was used during my tenure. Again, I would defer to EPA as to why
these results were not reported in their GHG RlA.

23. Please explain the process of photosynthesis.
See 4th grade science activities in Louisiana for a definition:

http://www.vrml.k12.la.us/4th/science/science bv unitOS/4th 5c unit4/un4act2 sc.htm

24. How many parts per million (ppm) do humans inhale of CO2 when they breathe? How many
ppm do humans exhale when they breathe?

Page 105

For gases by percentage, see http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing

25. Of all the ”pollutants” regulated by the Clean Air Act and EPA, please provide a list of all those
humans exhale at a greater rate than they inhale and at what rate in ppm are they exhaled?

I am not aware of any pollutants that are exhaled at a greater rate than they are inhaled, as is
carbon dioxide,

26. Albert Einstein once famously stated that "the right to search for truth implies also a duty; one
must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be true." Do you agree with this
statement?

Yes, in general.

27. In light of the Einstein quote, please answer the following questions based on
empirical evidence as well as provide the source for your answer:

i. What are all the natural influences on our climate and which ones are
we able to control or not control?

While the Third National Climate Assessment (NCA) can be referenced
to address the entirety of the questions, some natural influences on our
climate include varying solar output from the sun, volcanic eruptions,
and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Human factors are those
we can control and include the emissions of heat-trapping gases and
particles as well as clearing of forests and other land-use changes.

Additionally, the third NCA report explains that natural climate drivers
alone do not explain recent observed warming, and that over the last
half century the majority of the warming at the global scale can only be
explained by the effects of human influences, especially the emissions
from burning fossil fuels and from deforestation.

ii. For how long has the climate been changing and does climate change
predate the internal combustion engine?

Natural influences on our climate have been changing our climate long
before the invention of the internal combustion engine. However, the
scientific consensus from the nation’s climate experts states in the third
NCA that human activities have been the main driver of climate change
for the last half century.

Page 106

iii. Have global average temperatures over the last 15 years been
increasing, decreasing, or stayed virtually the same?

According to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), global average
temperatures have increased 0.167“C over the last 15 years above the
20th century average — from 046°C above the 20th century average in
1999 to 062°C above the 201h century average in 2013. The NCDC also
finds that 12 of the 13 warmest years on record have occurred in the
last 15 years.

iv. Has all climate change throughout earth’s geologic history been
negative?

The ever-changing climate has positive and negative impacts on people
and the environment across regions around the world. The rate at
which the climate is changing, primarily from the emissions of
greenhouse gases and deforestation resulting from human activities, is
expected to result in negative impacts that will outweigh positive
impacts on a global scale, as stated in the latest global assessment by
the leading climate scientists around the world according to the IPCC.

For example, the IPCC's ARS report states with high confidence that
”globally, positive impacts will be outweighed by the magnitude and
severity of negative impacts...”

The IPCC’s ARS report also states with very high confidence that “[r]ising
sea levels and storm surges, heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland
and coastal flooding, drought and water scarcity, and air pollution pose
widespread negative risks for people, health, livelihoods, assets, local
and national economies, and ecosystems..."

v. Over the last 100 years have hurricanes been increasing or decreasing in
number and intensity?

According to the IPCC’s ARS report, limited observation capabilities have
made it difficult to discern a trend in tropical cyclone activity over the
last century. However, the technological advancements (e.g., the
satellite era) have allowed for more comprehensive observations since
the 1970s, and they have revealed a robust increase in the intensity and
frequency of tropical systems in the North Atlantic. The IPCC also states


Page 107

that projections for the last century indicate a warmer world will result
in an increase in tropical cyclone strength and associated rainfall.

vi. How does the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635 compare to the recent
history of hurricanes in the United States over the last 5 years?

The lack of observational capabilities in the 1635 present challenges in
documenting the Great Colonial Hurricane (GCH) of 1635, which
according to NOAA, were mainly limited to the accounts of William
Bradford and John Winthrop, making a comprehensive assessment of
this hurricane extremely difficult.

Technological and scientific advancements have been exponential since
1635, and assessments of tropical cyclones are now rigorous and
comprehensive. When only taking into account tropical cyclones over
the past 5 years that each cost the United States more than $1 billion,
NCDC estimates they caused nearly $80 billion in aggregate costs.

vii. What decade was the worst decade for drought in the United States?

According to Richard Helm, a meteorologist and drought expert with
NCDC, ”In terms of percent area of country affected by drought (as
measured by the Palmer Drought Index), the 1930‘s Dust Bowl decade is
the worst drought on record by spatial area."

According to NCDC, ”[t]he ’dust bowl/ effect was caused by sustained
drought conditions compounded by years of land management
practices that left topsoil susceptible to the forces of the wind,"
meaning human activities played a role in the magnitude of the
drought.

viii. What decade was the worst decade for wildfires in the United States?

According to the third NCA report, “[S]easonal and multiyear droughts
affect wildfire severity. For example, persistent drought conditions in
the Southwest, combined with wildfire suppression and land
management practices, have contributed to wildfires of unprecedented
size since 2000. five western states (Arizona, Colorado, Utah, California,
and New Mexico) have experienced their largest fires on record at least
once since 2000. Much of the increase in fires larger than 500 acres
occurred in the western United States, and the area burned in the

Page 108

Southwest increased more than 300% relative to the area burned during
the 19705 and early 19805!”

The third NCA report also states, "drought and fire risk are increasing
in many regions as temperatures and evaporation rates rise. The greater
the future warming, the more these risks will increase, potentially
affecting the entire United States.”

ix. is the statement "What we do know is the temperature around the
globe is increasing faster than was predicted even ten years ago” an
accurate statement of global warming claims? Please provide the base
source and by what you are measuring for any supporting position.

According to NCDC, global average temperatures over the last 10 years
have continued to rise. While the increase temperatures has been at a
rate more in-line with the lower end of some model projections,
additional warming to global temperatures will only further enhance the
risk we face from the impacts of climate change in the United States and
globally.

x. What is the current rate of sea level rise, and how does it compare to
the first and second halves of the twentieth century? What has been
the average rate of seal level rise since the last ice age?

According to the lPCC ARS report, it is likely that global mean sea level
has accelerated since 1900. For a comprehensive and detailed answer
to your question, please reference the report.
http://www.ipcc.ch/report/arS/wgl/

xi. Please provide a list of the worst ten floods in world history based on
human impacts, including the country and date they occurred, and the
number of human lives lost.

National and international organizations like the National Climatic Data
Center and the World Meteorological Organization can likely provide
you with the answer to your question.

As an overall comment to your questions above, i would say that climate change is a naturally
occurring phenomenon that is exacerbated by human behavior, causing the climate to change at
a rate faster than the environment can adapt. While we cannot determine if a particular
weather event is caused by climate change, we can expect an increased frequency of extreme
weather events.

Page 109

Questions from:

Senator Jeff Sessions

1.

Administrator Whitman: your testimony acknowledges ”honest disagreement” about
“whether EPA may be stretching its legal authority a bit too far,” What did you mean by
that? Would you agree that there are aspects of EPA’s proposed greenhouse gas
regulations impacting power plants that may not comply with the requirements of law?

Some stakeholders are questioning EPA’s ability to regulate ”beyond the fence.” I trust that
the courts will determine whether EPA has this authority.

2. Even the mere threat of expensive new EPA regulations can hinder job creation and
economic growth. President Obama conceded this fact when, in 2011, he directed EPA to
not move forward with reconsideration of the ozone standard "particularly as our economy
continues to recover” (Pres. Obama, 9/2/2011). Isn’t it true that onerous climate
regulations can increase energy costs on American families?

Climate regulations may lead to increased energy costs but the costs of not acting are
significant as well.

3. The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled in the case of Utility Air Regulatory Group v.
Environmental Protection Agency. Do you agree with the Court‘s decision?

While I have read press reports of the decision, I have not reviewed the court’s ruling in
depth. it was a fractured and complicated decision, but i was encouraged that the Court
largely upheld the ability of the EPA to regulate greenhouse emissions.

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you very much, Governor Whit-
man. 

 We now turn to Mr. William Reilly. Welcome. 
STATEMENT OF WILLIAM K. REILLY, SENIOR ADVISOR, TPG 
CAPITAL; CHAIRMAN EMERITUS, CLIMATEWORKS FOUNDA-
TION; AND FORMER ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION AGENCY 

Mr. REILLY. Thank, Mr. Chairman, Senator Sessions and mem-
bers of the subcommittee. 

Thank you for convening this session on one of the critical chal-
lenges our Country faces. It is a privilege to appear with two of my 
predecessors and Governor Whitman who served after us. 

After I was nominated in 1988, my first briefing on climate was 
by Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, fol-
lowed soon by briefings on EPA’s reports on climate effects and pol-
icy options commissioned by Administrator Thomas. 

Incidentally, 11 National Academy of Science since that time 
have formally reflected upon and studied climate science and have 
concluded that humans are affecting the climate and greenhouse 
gases are changing it. 

At that time, climate science was a matter of computer modeling, 
coupled with theory, notably the greenhouse effect, which explains 
why the earth’s atmosphere is hospitable to life. At that time, the 
concern was sufficient to prompt then Secretary of State Jim Baker 
in his first statement on the topic to signal a policy of no regrets. 
We will consider those measures, he said, that address current pri-
orities that also help reduce gas emissions. 

The 1987 Montreal Protocol, which Lee Thomas helped negotiate, 
is an example of this kind of thinking. That was 25 years ago. 
Today, the models are far more reliable and they are buttressed by 
literally thousands of credible scientific studies documenting 
changes underway. 

I listened to Senator Boozman. There are still many outstanding 
questions, the pace of change, tipping points, local impacts, fugitive 
methane emissions and more. The earth’s climate is a complex sys-
tem. We do not have a complete picture. We welcome serious, con-
structive critiques that examine gaps, anomalies and uncertainties. 
That is how science advances our understanding of such complex 
issues. 

Change is underway. We can expect to see many more disrup-
tions, more intense storms, more wildfires, the spread of pests and 
diseases, dengue fever will arrive in America, storm surges that 
overwhelm coastal communities, heat waves and other impacts on 
our health, on water resources, on food production and on other 
sectors of our economy. 

The longer we delay, the more adverse the impacts will be and 
the more expensive will be to address them. Reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide, can help fend off more 
draconian impacts later this century. 

I increasingly believe we have a second, immediate agenda, 
namely to prompt States, communities and our Federal agencies to 
begin to adapt to likely changes and to buildup resiliency. Dealing 
with flooding and meeting future projections from storm surges will

Page 111 

be costly and add to growing demands on Federal, State and local 
budgets. I chaired a force task on adaptation for Governor 
Schwarzenegger. We concluded that the 1,100 levees in the Sac-
ramento Basin simply will not survive anticipated sea level rise. 
Climate change and associated disruptions, as has been pointed 
out, are a global problem. Absent action by China, Brazil, India 
and other fast growing economies, what we do alone will not suf-
fice. 

Action by the United States, if not sufficient, is nonetheless nec-
essary if we are to have credibility to negotiate with other coun-
tries who typically fault the developed world for causing the prob-
lem and worry that carbon constraints will thwart their legitimate 
needs for economic growth. 

I must express some disappointment that the debate between de-
veloped and developing countries has tended to focus more on how 
much financial aid advanced nations are willing to provide rather 
than on the substance of how much and how to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions in those nations. 
I participated for a number of years in the China Sustainable 
Energy Forum. At first, throughout the 1990’s, any mention of cli-
mate change triggered a lecture about how those who caused the 
problem should pay for fixing it globally. 
As China has begun to experience serious impacts, especially in 
water resources, it now is a matter of self interest that they re-
spond and join constructively in international negotiations, even as 
they continue to assert the national interest in development. 
China announced 1 day after the announcement by EPA of its 
new carbon rule that they intend to build a cap on carbon dioxide. 
This is obviously a response to the United States, a significant one, 
and it is further demonstration of U.S. leadership. 
Markets the world over seek clean energy technologies. Well over 
a billion people do not have electricity. For many, it will be small 
scale, renewable technologies that will help improve their lives and 
offer new economic opportunities. 
Technology and innovation are a comparative advantage for our 
Country that will help control what we can and help find ways to 
replace the most serious contributors to the climate challenge. 
This is an enormous opportunity for U.S. entrepreneurs and ex-
porters, even as we deploy more clean energy at home. While the 
President has taken many important steps, a full and constructive 
response is needed from Congress. 
In closing, I have little doubt that the planet will endure major 
climate disruptions. There have been many such episodes in the 
past due to natural causes, but you would have to reject the green-
house effect out right to conclude that human activities pumping 
millions of tons of CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmos-
phere every year are having little or no impact on the earth’s cli-
mate. 
That is simply not a tenable position. For me, the question is 
how hospitable this earth remains for future generations and for 
civilization as we know it. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Statement of the Honorable William K. Reilly
before the
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works
Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety
Washington, D.C.
June 18, 2014

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee,

Thank you for convening this session on one of the critical challenges our country faces.
It is a privilege to appear with two of my predecessors—three if you count Ruckelshaus twice!—
and Governor Whitman, who served after us.

Each of us, during our tenures, had to navigate the complexities of law, science,
economics, public policy, the prevailing winds of politics and public sentiments, and more on
any number of difficult issues to fulfill the intent of Congress and Americans‘ aspirations for
both a healthy, productive environment and a prosperous economy. We did so in what Bill
called a “fishbowl,“ all of it out in the open.

After I was nominated, my first briefing was on climate by Frank Press, president of the
National Academy of Sciences, followed soon by briefings on EPA‘s reports on climate effects
and policy options, commissioned by Administrator Thomas. At that time, climate science was a
matter of computer modeling coupled with theory, notably the “greenhouse effect," which I’m
sure you appreciate explains why the earth’s atmosphere is hospitable to life. At the time, the
concern was sufficient to prompt then-Secretary of State Jim Baker in his first statement on the
topic to signal a policy of “no regrets" — we will consider those measures that address current
priorities that also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 1987 Montreal Protocol, which
Lee helped negotiate, is an example of this kind of thinking.

With this as backdrop, President George H.W. Bush ensured that our Administration took
climate change seriously. I met regularly with my counterparts from the European Union to
discuss content, timing, targets, and other key issues. We hosted a major conference during the

Page 113

President’s term. And we negotiated with other countries the Framework Convention on Climate
Change, which the President signed at the Rio Earth Summit in l992 and submitted to the Senate
for ratification, which occurred in October 1992. The Framework Convention remains, for the
United States, the most important international treaty in effect on climate change.

That was 25 years ago. Today, the models are far more reliable and they are buttressed
by literally thousands of credible scientific studies documenting changes underway. I hasten to
add there are still many outstanding questions— the pace of change, tipping points, local impacts,
fugitive methane emissions, and more. Earth’s climate is a complex system and we do not have
a complete picture. We welcome serious, constructive critiques that examine gaps, anomalies,
uncertainties. That is how science advances our understanding of such complex issues.

That said, change is underway and we can expect to see many more disruptions, more
intense storms, more wildfires, the spread of pests and diseases. storm surges that overwhelm
coastal communities, heat waves, and other impacts on our health, on water resources, on food
production, and on other sectors of our economy. The longer we delay, the more adverse the
impacts will be, and the more expensive to address them.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide, can help fend off more
draconian impacts later this century. Yet I increasingly believe that we have a second,
immediate agenda, namely to prompt states and communities and our federal agencies to begin
to adapt to likely changes and to build up resiliency. If you read the Washington Post's June lSth
front-page story on Norfolk, Virginia. you get an excellent picture of the dilemma that
community faces—not to mention what the Navy’s base there faces. Dealing with flooding and
meeting future projections from storm surges will be costly, and the growing demands on
federal, state, and local budgets come at a time when the country seeks to reduce federal debt and
tame federal deficits.

Page 114

In other words, not only is climate change likely to affect natural resources and public
health, but it will have profound effects on our economy.

We have to take seriously that climate change and the associated disruptions are a global
problem, as Members of Congress, policymakers, scientists, and virtually everyone I know have
explicitly acknowledged. Absent action by China, India, and other fast-growing economics,
what we do alone will not suffice. Action by the United States, if not sufficient, is nonetheless
absolutely necessary if we are to have the credibility to negotiate with other countries, who
typically fault the developed world for causing the problem and worry that carbon constraints
will thwart their legitimate need for economic growth. We have to take this need for
development seriously and frame our approach in the international arena with this in mind.

In this international context, I must express some disappointment that the debate between
developed and developing countries has tended to focus more on how much financial aid
advanced nations are willing to provide rather than on the substance of how much and how to
reduce greenhouse gas emission in those nations. l have participated for years in the China
Sustainable Energy Forum; at first. any mention of climate change triggered a lecture about how
those who caused the problem should pay for fixing it globally. That has changed: as China has
begun to experience serious impacts, especially in water resources, you now hear China’s
officials and academics taking the matter very seriously. It is now a matter of national self—
interest that they respond and join constructively in international negotiations even as they
continue to assert their national interest in development.

Markets the world over eagerly seek clean energy technologies. Well over a billion
people do not have electricity. For many, it will be small-scale, renewable technologies that will
help improve their lives, offer new economic opportunities, preserve essential medicines and 
reduce food waste as refrigeration becomes possible, and more

Page 115

Technology and innovation are a comparative advantage for our country that will help
control what we can and help find ways to replace the most serious contributors to the climate
challenge. This is an enormous opportunity for U.S. entrepreneurs and exporters even as we
deploy more clean energy at home. Former Iowa Governor Chip Culver made wind power a
priority and that state went from 5% to 20% of electricity generation from wind power in 5
years; importantly, the state attracted turbine and other manufacturers, which in turn spawned
200 new small businesses in their supply chains. When the Governor asked the companies what
they most needed, the response was worker training and education. We can learn from this
experience.

We have the know-how, the ingenuity, the entrepreneurial spirit, the ability to
demonstrate leadership in tackling this challenge. While the President has taken many important
steps, a full and constructive response is needed from Congress. and I encourage you and your
colleagues to have the kinds of discussions that will lead to congressional action.

In closing, I have little doubt that the planet will endure major climate disruptions. As
scientists have confirmed. there have been many such episodes in the past due to natural
causes—changes in solar output, shifts in the earth‘s orbit, meteor impacts, volcanic eruptions,
and the like. But you would have to reject the “greenhouse effect" outright to conclude that
human activities pumping millions of tons of C02 and other greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere every year are having little or no impact on the earth’s climate. That is simply not a
tenable position. For me, the real question is about the future well-being of our communities,
our settlements, our economy—in short, how hospitable this earth remains for future generations
and for civilization as we know it.

Thank you.

RESPONSES FROM THE HONORABLE WILLIAM K. REILLY
TO QUESTIONS FROM ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS CHAIRMAN BOXER
AND RANKING MEMBER VITTER, PER JULY 9, 2014 LETTER

Senator Whitehouse

1. Before many environmental regulations are applied, dire consequences and worst fear
outcomes are usually perpetuated. How did the worst fears and assumptions of bad outcomes
from environmental regulations turn out in reality as the rules were applied in your own
experience?

Since the landmark environmental statutes were passed during the 1970s, we have
repeatedly heard from the regulated communities and others that this or that rule will
harm the economy, cost jobs, drive industry overseas, and otherwise imperil the United
States.

In 1979, The Conservation Foundation, which I headed, released a detailed study
Environmental Regulation of Industrial Plant Siting which concluded that compliance
costs for these regulations constituted a small fraction of production costs. Labor, raw
materials, transportation, and other factors were the primary drivers for business
decisions.

Moreover, American ingenuity and entrepreneurship have demonstrated again and
again that when we put our mind to it, innovation can help meet environmental
objectives. We heard that catalytic converters would undermine the auto industry; they
didn‘t. We heard that taking lead out of gasoline would harm automobile engines; it
didn’t. During the 1990 clean air amendment negotiations, we were told that
reformulating gasoline to reduce contaminants was costly. When the law passed,
industry found a way to meet the goal.

The fact is since 1970 we have made enormous strides in reducing conventional air
pollutants even while our population has grown, our energy consumption has grown, our
economy has doubled or more.

Senator Vitter

1. Author and environmental activist Bill McKibben has written that “you can have a healthy fossil fuel industry or a healthy planet, but you can't have both.”
Do you agree with this statement?

Continuing each year to pump billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,
in my view, can only further destabilize conditions with serious adverse consequences,
some of which we can foresee, others that will surprise us. Thus, i see the challenge

Page 117

ahead as moving to low carbon energy over time in ways that continue to maintain our
economy.

2. Mr. McKibben has also written that “one way to fight the power [of fossil fuel companies] is to
stop using fossil fuel."

Do you think this is realistic for consumers, in light of the fact that, as the International
Energy Agency noted, “Despite all the attention given to renewable energy, fossil fuels still
produce about four—fifths of the energy consumed worldwide?” Moreover, by 2050, the
REA projects that, even with its most aggressive carbon reduction scenario, fossil fuels
would still provide 45 percent of global energy demand. Do you agree with this projection?
More broadly, do you agree that, even as countries take steps to reduce carbon emissions,
fossil fuels will continue to comprise a substantial portion of the global energy mix in the
coming decades?

I see reliance on fossil fuels globally continuing for some time to come even with the
most optimistic scenario for deploying renewable energy,

3. Mr. McKibben has written that a “huge problem with increased reliance on cheap natural gas:
it undercuts the transition to zero—carbon energy sources like solar and wind power, locking us
into long-term reliance on fossil fuels.”

Do you agree with this statement? Do you believe that “reliance on cheap natural gas” has
been harmful or helpful to the U.S. economy, particularly for consumers and
manufacturers?

At the time of the 1990 amendments to the clean air act, no one had any idea that with
new drilling techniques natural gas would become more available. Nor did any of the
experts on the National Commission on Energy Policy, which included the CEO of a
major oil company, a former Deputy Secretary at DOE, utility executives, scientists, and
others appreciate what was coming when we released our report in 2004. All argued for
conserving natural gas supplies for those purposes for which there were no alternatives.

The advent of natural gas through horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has been a
game changer. Though there are long term implications since new power plants
typically have a 40 year or longer life span, there seems to me ample evidence that new
sources of natural gas have been a plus for the country and the economy - provided it
is extracted safely with proper safeguards regarding waste disposal, protection of water
resources, reduction of fugitive air emissions, including methane leaks, and with
community development impacts in mind, as well as respect for private property rights.
With sufficient planning, preparedness, safety procedures, and oversight, i believe
hydraulic fracturing can proceed as an industrial operation.

Page 118

4. Activist Naomi Klein wrote that “with the fossil-fuel industry, wrecking the planet is their
business model. It’s what they do.”
Do you agree with this statement?

I‘m not aware of any US, company, fossil fuel or otherwise, that deliberately seeks as a
business strategy to “wreck the planet.” That said, there have been many examples
during our history when unintended consequences, new information about impacts,
technological innovation that leads to less costly, less troublesome modes, or other
factors have caused us to re—think how we do business, how we sustain our economy
and improve opportunities and the quality of life for all Americans

5. On November 3, 2013, climate scientists Kerry Emanuel, Tom Wigley, James Hansen, and Ken
Caldeira, in an open letter to environmentalists, disputed the notion that world energy demand
could be met with 100 percent renewables. Nuclear, they contend, must be part of the equation:
“Renewables like wind and solar and biomass will certainly play roles in a future energy
economy, but those energy sources cannot scale up fast enough to deliver cheap and reliable
power at the scale the global economy requires. While it may be theoretically possible to
stabilize the climate without nuclear power, in the real world there is no credible path to
climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power.”

Do you agree with the authors of this statement?

l consider nuclear power a significant, indeed essential, part of the country’s electricity
generation. i say this with full appreciation that a new large, multi~reactor plant can cost
in the range of $12 to $14 billion or more, prompting the former CEO of Exelon, the
utility with the largest nuclear fleet, to comment that was the market capitalization of his
entire company and he would not be willing to bet his company on such a costly
undertaking.

Add to this challenge the matter of waste disposal and the United States’ clear security
interest in preventing nuclear proliferation.

That is one reason l'm intrigued by the prospect of small scale reactors, less costly and
suitable for deployment at installations, campuses, industrial parks and in combination
with micro grids.

Their deployment is some years off, i believe, and thus we need to look for means of
ensuring that current nuclear plants can continue to contribute to meeting the country’s
energy demand, with safety in mind, of course, We been impressed with the institute
for Nuclear Power Operations’ ability to improve performance continually,

6. According to Ted Nordhaus and Michael Schellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute,
“Whatever their merits as innovation policy, Germany’s enormous solar investments have had
little discernible impact on carbon emissions. Germany’s move away from baseload zero—

Page 119

carbon nuclear has resulted in higher coal consumption since 2009. In 2012, Germany's carbon
emissions rose 2 percent.”

Do you agree with this statement? Do you believe the U.S. should deploy more nuclear
instead of relying on renewables to provide baseload power?

Though I am familiar with Germany‘s intent to advance renewable power, I do not have
the precise numbers of what has or has not been achieved.

As to the future of nuclear power, please see my response to question 5. I believe
market forces will largely shape what kind of nuclear plants are built.

7. According to an analysis by the Economist magazine, renewable energy targets in Germany are
popular, but their economic consequences are not. As the Economist explained, consumers
“increasingly dislike” the “side-effects” of subsidizing renewable energy. “first, there is the
rising cost of electricity. This is a consequence of a renewable-energy law passed in 2000 which
guarantees not only 20 years of fixed high prices for solar and wind producers but also
preferred access to the electricity grid. As a result, Bavarian roofs now gleam with solar panels
and windmills dominate entire landscapes. Last year, the share of renewables in electricity
production hit a record 23.4%.”

The Economist explained further, “This subsidy is costly. The difference between the market
price for electricity and the higher fixed price for renewables is passed on to consumers, whose
bills have been rising for years. An average household now pays an extra €260 ($355) a year to
subsidize renewables: the total cost of renewable subsidies in 2013 was €16 billion. Costs are
also going up for companies, making them less competitive than rivals from America, where
energy prices are falling thanks to the tracking boom.”

Do you believe that Germany’s renewable energy policies have delivered zero-carbon
energy without harming consumers? Do you believe that states, as they attempt to meet
EPA’s emissions targets under the proposed Clean Power Plan for existing power plants,
can both deploy more renewable energy while doing so without raising the cost of
electricity, or imposing higher costs on consumers?

I do not know enough about Germany’s current electricity costs, the history of such
costs, the level of subsidies or other factors to answer the first part of the question.

Regarding the impact of EPA’s proposal, the proposal is just that - a proposal subject to
extensive consultations with stakeholders, which l’m confident will lead to adjustments
in the final rule. As that rule takes shape, more reliable cost estimates should be
forthcoming.

My sense is that electricity costs will rise regardless of this rule as we will have to deal
forthrightly with grid reliability, planning, preparedness, and recovery related to natural
disasters, cybersecurity, power outages, more costly fuel extraction methods, as well as
externalities — impacts on health, crops, buildings, and the like.

Page 120

8. Do you think the U.S. drilling boom, spurred by the technological advance of hydraulic
fracturing, coupled with horizontal drilling, has been positive or negative for the US. economy,
particularly for consumers?

Please see the response to question 3.

9. Do you think EPA’s Clean Power Plan will have a meaningful effect on reducing global
greenhouse gas concentrations by 2030? Please explain how the Clean Power Plan will prevent
rising sea levels, droughts, wildfires, and severe weather.

I refer to my testimony in which I stated that EPA‘s action, indeed U.S. action, by itself
will not be sufficient to reverse or slow the impacts associated with climate change.
Nonetheless, i see it as an essential step —- absent Congressional action on a national
response — if the United State is to have credibility in negotiating an international
framework that ensures China, lndia, Brazil, and other fast growing economies meet
their obligations.

ll). As you are at least tangentially aware, fossil resources provide the base molecules and products
that we need to manufacture virtually everything we use in a modern society. In fact, coal
combustion byproducts are what comprise, strengthen and make possible our roads and
infrastructure. Chemicals derived from oil and natural gas production are what are refined and
manufactured into virtually every product we use today, from computers to our homes, and are
what make possible wind turbines (all components derived, manufactured or refined from fossil
fuels) and solar panels (all components derived, manufactured or refined from fossil fuels).
Accordingly, many claims about eliminating our use of fossil resources are wholly illusory.
However, in order to provide a better understanding of some of your claims regarding our nation’s
dependence on these resources, other than counting intermittent electricity generation as a product,
please provide a comprehensive list of all the things that are a product or can be manufactured out
of sunlight and wind (again, please exclude electricity).

Having served on the boards of DuPont and ConocoPhillips, I am well that fossil fuels
provide inputs and raw material for purposes other than generating electricity and will
likely continue to do so.

i have no comprehensive list at my disposal of products from sunlight or wind though i
would note that humans depend on sunlight as do other species, including plants — sea
grasses essential for fisheries; trees that provide lumber, fruit, mulch, seeds, wildlife
habitat, water filtration; and, of course, food crops. Communities around the Andes and
the Himalayas rely on the sun melting glaciers for drinking water —~ at least as long as
the glaciers remain,

10. Please explain the process of photosynthesis.

I refer you to Wikipedia, which has a good explanation:

“Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light
energy, normally from the sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to
fuel the organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate
molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water
—- hence the name photosynthesis….in most cases, oxygen is also released as a
waste product. Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform
photosynthesis, and such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis
maintains atmospheric oxygen levels and supplies all of the organic compounds
and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.

Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process
always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction
centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments. In plants, these proteins are
held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells,
while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane, in these light-
dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable
substances such as water, producing oxygen gas. Furthermore, two further
compounds are generated: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the "energy currency" of
cells...

The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary
history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or
hydrogen sulfide as sources of electrons, rather than water. Cyanobacteria
appeared later, and the excess oxygen they produced contributed to the oxygen
catastrophe, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. Today, the
average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130
terawatts, which is about six times larger than the current power consumption of
human civilization, Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100~115
thousand million metric tonnes of carbon into biomass per year.”

11. Are there any other “pollutants” regulated under the Clean Air Act that are necessary to the
process of photosynthesis?

Not that I am aware of.
Page 122

12. How many parts per million (ppm) do humans inhale of C02 when they breathe? How many
ppm do humans exhale when they breathe?

i do not have this information handy.

13. Of all the “pollutants” regulated by the Clean Air Act and EPA, please provide a list of all those
humans exhale at a greater rate than they inhale and at what rate in ppm are they exhaled.

l’m not aware that humans exhale any of the 6 criteria air pollutants covered under the
clean air act, though substantial research has confirmed that breathing in sulfur dioxide,
carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxide, ozone, or particulates are not good for anyone’s
health.

14. While you were Administrator in 1992, you commissioned an Expert Panel on the Role of
Science at EPA to help identify how EPA could meet the goal of using sound science as the
foundation for the Agency’s policy and program decisions. The Panel reported to you that
“EPA science is of uneven quality, and the Agency’s policies and regulations are frequently
perceived as lacking a strong scientific foundation.” it also found that “the Agency is perceived
to have a conﬂict of interest because it needs science to support its legal activities.” EPA has
made little progress in becoming a source of unbiased scientific information over the years. Did
you implement the recommendations made by the Panel to ensure the EPA made all regulatory
decisions based on sound, peer-reviewed science? Do you believe the EPA has fully embraced
all of these suggestions and committed itself to basing its actions on sound science and
transparency?

From the time I was named EPA Administrator, I put a high priority on science in the
agency. The Reducing Risk report was intended to help better align the EPA budget
with the most serious risks.

The expert panel cited was also an attempt to improve the agency‘s scientific
capabilities. i learned at the start that Administrators do not always have all the
information at hand one would like, Budget constraints, gaps in data and scientific
understanding, incomplete risk assessments, inadequate testing or sampling
methodologies, and other factors can limit this information. Nonetheless, the laws or a
risk assessment often requires action. Weighing what you have to go on falls to the
Administrator.

Page 123

Since I left EPA in early 1993, l did not have the opportunity to see through the various recommendations.

As for EPA's science capabilities today, i am not close enough to observe internal
operations. I would note, however, that Bill Ruckelshaus was the first to remark that all
of EPA’s business is transacted in a fishbowl. There is no shortage of outside
stakeholders, reviewers, advocates, and the like.

1. Albert Einstein once famously stated that “the right to search for truth implies also a duty; one must not conceal
any part of what one has recognized to be true.” Do you agree with this statement?

a. In light of the Einstein quote, please answer the following questions based on
empirical evidence as well: as provide the source for your answer:

i. What are all the natural inﬂuences on our climate and which ones are we
able to control or not control?

While the Third National Climate Assessment (M) can be
referenced to address the entirety of the questions, some natural
influences on our climate include varying solar output from the sun,
volcanic eruptions, and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
Human factors are those we can control and include the emissions of
heat-trapping gases and particles as well as clearing of forests and
other land—use changes.

Additionally, the third NCA report explains that natural climate drivers
alone do not explain recent observed warming, and that over the last
half century the majority of the warming at the global scale can only
be explained by the effects of human influences, especially the
emissions from burning fossil fuels and from deforestation.

ii. For how long has the climate been changing and does climate change
predate the internal combustion engine?

Natural influences on our climate have been changing our climate
long before the invention of the internal combustion engine.
However, the scientific consensus from the nation’s climate experts
states in the third NCA that human activities have been the main
driver of climate change for the last half century

Page 124

iii. Have global average temperatures over the last 15 years been increasing,
decreasing, or stayed virtually the same?

According to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), global
average temperatures have increased 0.167°C over the last 15
years above the 20‘h century average — from 046°C above the 20th
century average in 1999 to 062°C above the 20th century average
in 2013. The NCDC also finds that 12 of the 13 warmest years on
record have occurred in the last 15 years.

iv. Has all climate change throughout earth’s geologic history been negative?

The ever-changing climate has positive and negative impacts to
people and the environment across regions around the world. The
rate at which the climate is changing, primarily from the emissions
of greenhouse gases and deforestation resulting from human
activities, is expected to result in negative impacts that will
outweigh positive impacts on a global scale. As stated in the latest
global assessment by the leading climate scientists around the
world according to the lPCC.

For example, the IPCC’s AR5 report states with high confidence
that “[g]lobally, positive impacts will be outweighed by the
magnitude and severity of negative impacts...”

The IPCC’s _AR_5 report also states with very high confidence that
“[r]ising sea levels and storm surges, heat stress, extreme
precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, drought and water
scarcity, and air pollution pose widespread negative risks for
people, health, livelihoods, assets, local and national economies,
and ecosystems..."

v. Over the last 100 years have hurricanes been increasing or decreasing in number and intensity?

According to the IPCC's ﬂ report, limited observation capabilities
have made it difficult to discern a trend in tropical cyclone activity
over the last century. However, the technological advancements
(e.g., the satellite era) have allowed for more comprehensive
observations since the 19705 and have revealed a robust increase
in the intensity and frequency of tropical systems in the North
Atlantic. The IPCC also states that projections for the 20th century

Page 125

indicate a warmer world will result in an increase in tropical cyclone
strength and associated rainfall.

vi. How does the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635 compare to the recent
history of hurricanes in the United States over the last 5 years?

The lack of observational capabilities in 1635 present Challenges in
documenting the Great Colonial Hurricane (GCH) of 1635, which
according to NOAA were mainly limited to the accounts of William
Bradford and John Winthrop, making a comprehensive assessment
extremely difficult for the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635,

Technological and scientific advancements have been exponential
since 1635, and assessments of tropical cyclones are now rigorous
and comprehensive. When only taking into account tropical
cyclones over the past 5 years that each cost the United States
more than $1 billion, NCDC estimates they caused nearly $80
billion in aggregate costs

 

v. What decade was the worst decade for drought in the United States?

According to Ephard Heim, a meteorologist and drought expert
with NCDC, "In terms of percent area of country affected by drought
(as measured by the Palmer Drought Index), the 1930‘s Dust Bowl
decade is the worst drought on record by spatial area."

According to Mpg, “[t]he ‘dust bowl’ effect was caused by
sustained drought conditions compounded by years of land
management practices that left topsoil susceptible to the forces of
the wind," meaning human activities played a role in the magnitude
of the drought.

vi. What decade was the worst decade for wildfires in the United States?

According to the third NCA report, “[s]easonal and multi-year
droughts affect wildfire severity, For example, persistent drought
conditions in the Southwest, combined with wildfire suppression
and land management practices, have contributed to wildfires of
unprecedented size since 2000. five western states (Arizona,
Colorado, Utah, California, and New Mexico) have experienced
their largest tires on record at least once since 2000. Much of the

Page 126

increase in fires larger than 500 acres occurred in the western
United States, and the area burned in the Southwest increased
more than 300% relative to the area burned during the 1970s and
early 1980s”

The third NCA report also states, “[dlrought and fire risk are
increasing in many regions as temperatures and evaporation rates
rise. The greater the future warming, the more these risks will
increase, potentially affecting the entire United States.“

ix. is the statement “What we do know is the temperature around the globe is
increasing faster than was predicted even ten years ago” an accurate
statement of global warming claims? Please provide the base source and by
what you are measuring for any supporting position.

According to NCDC, global average temperatures over the last 10
years have continued to rise. While the increase temperatures has
been at a rate more in-line with the lower end of some model
projections, additional warming to global temperatures will only
further enhance the risk we face from the impacts of climate
change in the United States and globally.

X. What is the current rate of sea level rise, and how does it compare to the
first and second halves of the twentieth century? What has been the
average rate of sea level rise since the last ice age?

According to the IPCC gas report, it is likely that global mean sea
level has accelerated since 1900. For a comprehensive and
detailed answer to your question, please reference the report,
http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wq1/

xi. Please provide a list of the worst ten floods in world history based on human
impacts, including the country and date they occurred, and the number of
human lives lost.

National and international organizations like the National Climatic
Data Center and the World Meteorological Organization can likely
provide you with the answer to your question.

17.1 Please explain your exact role in the 2007 buyout of TXU.

Page 127

a. Were you ever involved in the negotiations to cancel coal fired power plants?
b. What environmental groups did you bring to the table for negotiations?

c. Did any money exchange hands with any environmental groups as part of this
negotiation or were any promises made to contribute to any environmental groups?

d. According to a May 2, 2014 article in the Washington Post, “A lot of banks and big
investors got burned in the bankruptcy last week of Energy Future Holdings, a
Texas electric utility that in 2007 had been acquired for $45 billion in one of the
largest leveraged buyouts ever. But the private—equity folks who put the deal
together, thanks to fees and tax deductions, will walk away virtually unscathed and
possibly slightly ahead.”

i. How did your personal financial situation change as a result of this
bankruptcy?

ii. What was the exact financial impact to you personally as a result of the 2007
negotiations (how much were you paid), what was your stake in the
company, and how did that stake change between 2007 and the 2014
bankruptcy?

iii. How has your thinking on shale gas changed as a result of this bankruptcy?

e. The same Washington Post article reported that “One set of players managed to
walk away in decent shape: the private—equity firms that engineered the buyout in
the first place.”

i. How much was your firm paid in this transaction, and was your
compensation at all based on negotiations with the environmental
community to terminate coal

I have served as a Senior Advisor to TPG Capital and in that capacity led the
negotiations in the TXU transaction on environmental commitments with EDF
and NRDC. We agreed to a suite of environmental priorities and commitments,
including a reduction in planned coal-fired power plants of 8 in Texas and 3 in
other deregulated states. Neither environmental group received compensation or
a promise of future compensation from TPG.

l have served throughout the period since the negotiations and purchase as a
member of the board of Energy Future Holdings for which I was compensated
$250,000 per year, half in shares now of doubtful value and half in cash. I was
awarded compensation following the transaction which principally took the form
of carried interest in the anticipated profit of the company in the event of a future
sale. As a result of the bankruptcy there are no such profits and I will receive no
carried interest.

Although the shale gas boom with its resulting low gas price has been

Page 128

responsible for the bankruptcy of EFH, it has been a boon to the U.S. economy
and environment. Done right it can continue to benefit consumers and reduce
C02 emissions

Since I was an advisor, I had no responsibility for nor access to TPG accounts.

18. What years were you affiliated with the World Wildlife Fund?

a. What was your salary while serving on the WWF Board?

I served as President of WWFUS from 1985 until i was sworn in as EPA Administrator
in 1989. I served on the WWF Board of Directors after leaving EPA in 1993, including
two terms as board chairman. I remain on the board as Chairman Emeritus

WWF does not compensate directors; indeed, it works the other way: directors typically
contribute to the organization.

Senator Sessions

1. What do you think should be the role of nuclear power in America’s generating mix?

I consider nuclear power a significant, indeed essential, part of the country’s electricity
generation i say this with full appreciation that a new large, multi-reactor plant can cost
in the range of $12 to $14 billion or more, prompting the former CEO of Exelon, the
utility with the largest nuclear fleet, to comment that was the market capitalization of his
entire company and he would not be willing to bet his company on such a costly
undertaking.

Add to this challenge the matter of waste disposal and the United States’ clear security
interest in preventing nuclear proliferation.

That is one reason I‘m intrigued by the prospect of small scale reactors. Less costly and
suitable for deployment on installations, campuses, industrial parks and in combination
with micro grids.

Their deployment is some years off, I believe, and thus we need to look at means of
ensuring that current nuclear plants can continue to contribute to meeting the country’s
energy demand, with safety in mind, of course. I’ve been impressed with the Institute
for Nuclear Power Operations’ ability to improve performance continually.

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you very much, Mr. Reilly. 
We now turn to former Administrator Thomas. Welcome. 
STATEMENT OF LEE M. THOMAS, FORMER ADMINISTRATOR, 
U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 

Mr. THOMAS. Thank, Mr. Chairman, Senator Sessions and mem-
bers of the subcommittee for holding the hearing and giving me an 
opportunity to offer a perspective on climate change based upon my 
experience at EPA dealing with many complex environmental 
issues during the Reagan years. 

I have approached the issue using a risk assessment and risk 
management process. This is the approach we used during my time 
at EPA as we addressed a range of environmental problems. 
Whether it was assessing the impact of stratospheric ozone de-
pletion caused by chlorofluorocarbons or the impact of lead and 
gasoline on children’s health, scientific data and analysis was the 
first step in evaluating the risk posed by the problem. 

During my 6 years at EPA, I dealt with many contentious issues, 
first, as Assistant Administrator for 2 years and later as Adminis-
trator for a little over 4 years. I cannot remember any other mat-
ters I dealt with during that 6 year period of time that were not 
controversial—some more than others. 

The issue of climate change is one that the EPA and the global 
scientific community have studied and analyzed for decades, 
whether it is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or 
the latest scientific valuation that was authorized by Congress, the 
National Climate Assessment. 

There appears to be clear evidence regarding climate change and 
its anthropogenic foundation. We know that carbon dioxide con-
centrations in the atmosphere have increased by 40 percent since 
pre-industrial times. 

We know that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are 
warming the atmosphere. We know they have contributed to a 
more than 1–1/2 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures 
since the 1880’s. 

We know global sea level has risen by an average of 8 inches 
since 1870, primarily from thermal expansion caused by warmer 
oceans and some melting of glaciers on the Greenland and West 
Antarctic ice sheets. 

We know that ocean acidification is occurring, harming our coral 
reefs and marine ecosystems and we know that communities in our 
Country are dealing today with the effects of changing climate. 
In the State of Florida where I live, we see increasing salt water 
intrusion infiltrating our drinking water supply along the coast due 
to sea level rise. We see coastal communities dealing with the im-
pact of sea level rise on their drainage systems. A major part of the 
systems in south Florida are being impacted. 

The economic impact is undeniable and the local governments 
struggle to address today’s impacts of climate change while trying 
to anticipate the increased risk in the future is real. 

On a broader scale, scientific analysis of the issue points to wide-
spread impacts across our Country. They range from the depleted 
shellfish harvest in the Pacific Northwest that Bill mentioned due 
to ocean acidification or to increased drought and wildfires in the

southwest the National Climate Assessment Report suggested were 
linked to climate change. 

Given this assessment of the impacts and risks posed by global 
warming, EPA has the responsibility given to it by Congress and 
affirmed by the courts to address the risk management challenge. 
We know there are many approaches that can be taken and we also 
know that all of them are controversial. 

We know the gases we have emitted will remain in the atmos-
phere for decades to centuries and recognize that the solution will 
require a long term commitment if we are to mitigate both the ef-
fects already occurring and those forthcoming. 

We also know what many of the solutions are, some of which, 
Senator Sessions, you mentioned such as improving energy effi-
ciency and increasing our reliance on low emission energy produc-
tion. Widespread adoption of strategies like these can supplement 
an international agreement to reduced emissions. 

In addition, a coordinated national and international approach is 
needed to assist States and countries in implementing adaptation 
measures dealing with the impacts of climate change already tak-
ing place today. 

Clearly more action is needed to address the impacts today while 
addressing the larger issue of committing ourselves to avoiding 
dangerous levels of future warming. The recent steps taken by the 
EPA to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are significant mitigation 
measures and once again position the U.S. to demonstrate inter-
national leadership on an issue of global significance and con-
sequence. 

I would suggest if the United States is not taking the leadership 
position that international agreement will never come to fruition. 
Thank you again for the opportunity to present my views to the 
subcommittee on what I consider a critically important issue. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Thomas follows:]

Statement of the Honorable Lee M. Thomas
Former Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
before the
United States Committee on Environment and Public Works
Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety
Washington, D.C.
June 18, 2014

Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the deliberations of this
Subcommittee.

I am pleased to be here to offer a perspective on climate change based upon my experience at the
Environmental Protection Agency dealing with similar issues. I've approached the issue using a
risk assessment and risk management process. This is the approach I used during my time at
EPA as we addressed a range of environmental problems.

Whether it was assessing the impact of stratospheric ozone depletion caused by
Chlorofluorocarbons, or the impact of lead in gasoline on children’s health, scientific data and
analysis were the first step in evaluating the risk posed by the problem.

During my six years at the Environmental Protection Agency I dealt with many contentious
issues first as Assistant Administrator and later as Administrator. As Assistant Administrator,
challenges involved implementing the new Superfund statute and working with Congress on
reauthorizing and putting into effect law on the disposal of hazardous waste and leaking
underground storage tanks. Then as Administrator, addressing major environmental issues. I
can’t remember any of the matters I dealt with during my tenure at the Environmental Protection
Agency that were not controversial some more so than others, ranging from setting safe drinking
water standards to clean air requirements.

The issue of climate change is one that the EPA and the global scientific community have
studied and analyzed for decades. And since my time as Administrator, the assessment of risk
global warming poses to public health and the environment has continually improved and
become more certain. Whether it is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or the latest
scientific valuation authorized by Congress, the National Climate Assessment, there is clear
evidence regarding climate change and its anthropogenic foundation.

We know that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by 40 percent
since pre—industrial times.

We know that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are warming the atmosphere,
contributing to a more than 15°F rise in global temperatures since 1880.

We know global sea level has risen by an average of eight inches since 1870 primarily from
thermal expansion caused by warmer oceans and the melting of glaciers and the Greenland and
West Antarctic ice sheets.

Page 132

We know that ocean acidification is occurring. harming our coral reefs and marine ecosystems.
Absorbing about a quarter of our emissions each year, the current rate of acidification is roughly
50 times faster than known historical change.

We know that communities in our country are already dealing with the effects of the changing
climate today. In my state of Florida. we see increasing salt water intrusion infiltrating our
drinking water supply due to sea level rise. Coastal communities are dealing with the impact sea
level rise is having on their drainage systems, resulting in an investment of more than $300
million to upgrade flood mitigation infrastructure in Miami Beach alone. The economic impact is
undeniable, and local governments struggle to address today‘s impacts of climate change while
trying to anticipate the increased risk it poses in the future.

On a broader scale, scientific analysis of the issue points to widespread impacts across our
country. They range from depleted shellfish harvests in the Pacific Northwest due to ocean
acidification, to increased drought and wildfires in the Southwest and a more than 70 percent rise in the occurrence of heavy downpours in the Northeast since the late 1950s.

Given this assessment of the impacts and risk posed by global warming, the EPA has the
responsibility given to it by Congress, and affirmed by the courts, to address the risk
management challenge. We know there are many approaches that can be taken. and all are
controversial. We know the gases we have emitted will remain in the atmosphere for decades to
centuries, and recognize that the solution will require a long-term commitment if we are to
mitigate both the effects already occurring and those forthcoming.

But we also know what many of the solutions are, like improving energy efficiency and
increasing our reliance on low-emission energy production. Widespread adoption of strategies
like these can supplement an international agreement to reduce emissions. In addition, a
coordinated national and international approach is needed to assist states and countries
implement adaption measures dealing with the impacts of climate change already taking place
today.

Clearly more action is needed to address the impacts today while addressing the larger issue of
committing ourselves to avoiding dangerous levels of future warming. The recent steps taken by
the EPA to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are significant mitigation measures and once again
position the US to demonstrate international leadership on an issue of global significance and
consequence.

Thank you again for the opportunity to present my views to the Subcommittee on this critically
important issue.

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you very much, Mr. Thomas. 
Before I go on to the next witness, let me thank each of you for 
your service to our Country in a challenging office over many years 
and for your testimony today. 
We now turn now to Dr. Botkin. 

STATEMENT OF DANIEL BOTKIN, PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF 
BIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA BARBARA 

Mr. BOTKIN. Thank, Mr. Chairman. 

I come here today as a scientist who since 1968 has published 
research on the possibility of human-induced global warming and 
its potential human and ecological effects. 

In 1970, I developed a computer model of forest use from then 
to the present to forecast possible climate change effects on forests 
and their endangered species. In the 1980’s, one of my graduate 
students added world vegetation to a major climate model. 

In this new century, I was the lead author on a paper analyzing 
methods to forecast global warming impacts on biodiversity and 
published a paper comparing Arctic sea ice extent in the 19th cen-
tury with that of the end of the 20th century. 

I have spent my career trying to help conserve our environment 
and its great diversity of species, attempting to maintain an objec-
tive, intellectually honest approach in the best tradition of sci-
entific endeavors. 

I have been dismayed and disappointed in recent years that this 
subject has been converted into a political and ideological debate. 
I have colleagues on both sides of the debate and believe we should 
work together as scientists instead of arguing divisively about pre-
conceived, emotionally based positions. 

I was an expert reviewer of both the IPCC and the White House 
National Climate Assessment. I want to State up front that we 
have been living through a warming trend driven by a variety of 
influences. 

However, it is my view that this is not unusual and contrary to 
the characterizations by the two reports, these environmental 
changes are not apocalyptic or irreversible. I hope my testimony 
here will help lead to a calmer, more rational approach to dealing 
with climate change and with other major environmental problems. 
The two reports do not promote the kind of rational discussion 
we should be having. I would like to tell you why. 

My biggest concern is that the IPCC 2014 and White House Cli-
mate Change Assessment Reports present a number of speculative, 
sometimes incomplete conclusions embedded in language that gives 
them more scientific heft than they deserve. The reports are sci-
entific sounding rather than based on clearly settled facts. 
Established facts about the global environment exists less often 
in science than laymen usually thing. The two reports assume and 
argue that the climate warming forecast by the global climate 
model is happening and will continue to happen and grow worse. 
As you can see from Christine’s graph over here, currently these 
predictions are way off the reality. 

The extreme overemphasis on human induced global warming 
has taken our attention away from many environmental issues that 
used to be front and center but have been pretty much ignored in 

VerDate Aug 31 2005 10:54 Feb 25, 2016 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00139 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\_EPW\DOCS\98181.TXT VERN

134 

the 21st Century. By my count, there are ten issues, a number of 
which have been mentioned here today, including global warming. 
A singular focus on climate change as the driver of the other 
nine obscures the best solutions to this full suite of environmental 
challenges we face. In terms of the need to act now, it is on these 
issues that we should focus with the concern over possible global 
warming prioritized properly within that group. 

There is an implicit assumption in both reports that nature is in 
steady State, that all change is negative and undesirable for all 
life, including people. This is the opposite of the reality. The envi-
ronment has always changed. Living things have had to adapt to 
these changes and many require change. 

The report gives the impression that living things are fragile and 
rigid, unable to deal with change. The opposite is the case. Life is 
persistent, adaptable and adjustable. In particular, the IPCC report 
for policymakers repeats the assertion of previous IPCC reports 
that large fractions of species face increased extinction risks. Over-
whelming evidence contradicts this assertion. 

The models making these forecasts use incorrect assumptions 
leading to over estimates of extinction rates. Surprisingly few spe-
cies became extinct during the past 2.5 million years, a period en-
compassing several ice ages and warm periods. 

Some of the reports’ conclusions are the opposite of those given 
in articles cited in defense of those conclusions. The White House 
Climate Change Assessment includes a table of 30 different ecologi-
cal effects resulting from climate change. 

I reviewed the studies cited to support this table and found not 
a single one of the 30 is supported by direct observations. 
The IPCC Terrestrial Ecosystem Report states that 7 of 19 sub-
populations of polar bears are declining in number, citing in sup-
port of this an article by Vongraven and Richardson but these au-
thors State the contrary, that the decline is an illusion. 
On May 22, Vongraven stated that the polar bear population size 
never has been an estimate of total abundance in a scientific sense, 
but simply a qualified guess given to satisfy public demand. 
Some conclusions contradict and are ignorant of the best statis-
tically valid observations. For example, the IPCC Report says that 
terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems have sequestered about a 
quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere by human 
activities in the past three decades. 

I have done the first statistically valid estimates of carbon stor-
age and uptake for any large area of the earth and can tell you 
that estimates of carbon uptake like vegetation used by IPCC are 
not statistically valid and over estimate carbon storage and uptake 
by as much as 300 percent. 

Finally, the IPCC Report uses the term ‘‘climate change’’ with 
two meanings, natural and human induced. I have heard that 
today over and over again. They are not distinguished in the text 
and therefore are confusing. 

Of course the climate is changing. It has always changed and it 
always will change. If the statement is assumed to be about nat-
ural change, then it is a truism, something people have always 
known and experienced. If the meaning is taken to be human 
caused, then the available data do not support the statements.

Testimony of DANIEL B. BOTKIN
Before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety
“Climate Change: The Need to Act Now."
June 18, 2014 at 10:00 A.M.

Since 1968, I have published research on theoretical global warming, its potential ecological
effects, and the implications for people and biodiversity. Some examples: In 1970. I developed the first
computer model of forests used in many versions around the world from then to the present to forecast
possible climate change effects on forests. In the l980s, one of my graduate students added world vegetation
to a major climate model. In 2010. I published a paper comparing century Arctic sea ice extent in the
nineteenth with that at the end of twentieth century. I have a paper in press giving the first statistically valid
estimates of forest carbon sequestering for large areas of the Earth.

I have spent my career trying to help conserve our environment and its great diversity of species.
Some examples: When the Marine Mammal Protection Act was passed in 1973, the Commission asked me to
analyze the law and explain its key concepts both ecologically and legally; I served on a California State
Committee to advise what to do about the then 22 condors remaining in the wild; Under a special bill passed
by the Oregon State Legislature, I directed a five year study of the relative effects of forest practices on
salmon; Under a special bill passed by the California State Legislature. I directed a study concerning Mono
Lake, whose supply of fresh water had been completely diverted to Los Angeles: at the request of the city of
Los Angeles, I wrote a report concerning the use of trees, shrubs and other vegetation in a city in a semi-arid
environment; I have advised the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission: served as the
U. S. representative of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. I have published 14 books
about nature and people including one of the leading environmental science textbooks.

I have always attempted to maintain an objective, intellectually honest, scientific approach in the

Page 137

best tradition of scientific endeavor and have been dismayed and disappointed in recent years that this
subject has been converted into a political and ideological debate, I have colleagues on both sides of the
debate and believe we should work together as scientists instead of arguing divisively about preconceived,
emotionally-based “positions.” I hope my testifying here will help lead to a calmer, more rational approach
to dealing with not only climate change but also other major environmental problems. The IPCC 2014 report
and the White House Climate Change Assessment do not have this kind of rational discussion we should be
having. I would like to tell you why.

The IPCC 2014 report is actually series of reports, each long, complex in organization, and
extensive in scope. The White House Report is 881 pages. Since it’s not possible to discuss these
documents thoroughly in detail today, I will highlight some of my thoughts for you here as they relate to the
reports, hoping to bring a saner, more sober approach to this highly charged issue.

To characterize where we are with these reports and this issue, I would like to quote James R.
Schlesinger, the first US. Energy Secretary, who said: “We have only two modes complacency and
panic. ” — commenting on the country’s approach to energy (1977).

Now to my major points.

i. I want to state up front that we have been living through a warming trend driven by a
variety of influences. However, it is my View that this is not unusual, and contrary to the
characterizations by the IPCC and the National Climate Assessment, these environmental changes
are neither apocalyptic nor irreversible.

2. My biggest concern is that both the reports present a number of speculative, and sometimes
incomplete, conclusions embedded in language that gives them more scientific heft than they
deserve. The reports are "scientific—sounding" rather than based on clearly settled facts or
admitting their lack. Established facts about the global environment exist less often in science

Page 138

them laymen usually think.

3. HAS IT BEEN WARMING? Yes, we have been living through a warming trend, no doubt
about that. The rate of change we are experiencing is also not unprecedented, and the “mystery”
of the warming “plateau” simply indicates the inherent complexity of our global biosphere.
Change is normal; life on Earth is inherently risky. It always has been. The two reports,
however, makes it seem that environmental change is apocalyptic and irreversible. It is not.

4. IS CLIMATE CHANGE VERY UNUSUAL? No, it has always undergone changes.

5. ARE GREENHOUSE GASES INCREASING? Yes, C02 rapidly.

6. IS THERE GOOD SCIENTIfiC RESEARCH ON CLIMATE CHANGE? Yes, a great
deal of it.

7. ARE THERE GOOD SCIENTISTS INVOLVED IN THE IPCC 2014 REPORT? Yes, the
lead author of the Terrestrial (land) Ecosystem Report is Richard Betts, a coauthor of one my
scientific papers about forecasting effects of global warming on biodiversity.

8. ARE THERE SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE STATEMENTS AT PLACES IN THE
REPORT? Yes, there are.

9. What I sought to learn was the overall take-away that the reports leave with a reader. I
regret to say that I was left with the impression that the reports overestimate the danger from
human—induced climate change and do not contribute to our ability to solve major
environmental problems. I am afraid that an “agenda" permeates the reports, an implication
that humans and our activity are necessarily bad and ought to be curtailed.

10. ARE THERE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE REPORTS? Yes, in assumptions, use of
data, and conclusions.

11. My biggest concern about the reports is that they present a number of speculative, and

Page 139

sometimes incomplete, conclusions embedded in language that gives them more scientific heft
than they deserve. The reports, in other words, are "scientific—sounding," rather than clearly settled
and based on indisputable facts. Established facts about the global environment exist less often in
science than laymen usually think.

12. The two reports assume and/or argue that the climate warming: forecast by the global climate
models is happening and will continue to happen and grow worse. Currently these predictions
are way off the reality (figure l). Models, like all scientific theory, have to be tested against real—
world observations. Experts in model validation say that the climate models frequently cited in the
IPCC report are little if any validated. This means that as theory they are fundamentally scientifically
unproven.

John Christy, University of Alabama and Alabama State Climatologist. Reproduced with permission
from him.)

Warming Predictions vs. the Real World
<See original document for chart>
 

14. The reports suffer from the use term “climate change” with two meanings: natural and
human-induced. These are both given as definitions in the IPCC report and are not
distinguished in the text and therefore confuse a reader. (The White House Climate Change

Page 140

Assessment uses the term throughout including its title, but never defines it.) There are places in the
reports where only the second meaning—human induced———makes sense, so that meaning has to be
assumed. There are other places where either meaning could be applied.

a. In those places where either meaning can be interpreted, if the statement is assumed to be a
natural change, then it is a truism, a basic characteristic of Earth's environment and
something people have always known and experienced. If the meaning is taken to be
human-caused, then in spite of the assertions in the report, the available data do not support
the statements.

15. Some of the reports’ conclusions are the opposite of those given in articles cited in
defense of these conclusions. For example, the IPCC 2014 Terrestrial Ecosystem Report states
that “there is medium confidence that rapid change in the Arctic is affecting its animals. For
example, seven of 19 subpopulations of the polar bear are declining in number” citing in
support of this an article by Vongraven and Richardson, 2011. That report states the contrary,
that the “‘decline’ is an illusion.

In addition, I have sought the available counts of the l9 subpopulations. of these, only three have
been counted twice; the rest have been counted once. Thus no rate of changes in the populations can
be determined. The first count was done in 1986 for one subpopulation.1

On May 22, Vongraven, a member of the international team that created these estimates, stated
that the polar bear population size, “never has been an estimate of total abundance in a scientific
sense, but simply a qualified guess given to satisfy public demand. . .the range given for total global
population should be viewed with great caution as it cannot be used to assess population trend over
the long term.” The U. S. Marine Mammal Commission, charged with the conservation of this
species, acknowledges “Accurate estimates of the current and historic sizes of polar bear stocks are

Page 141

difficult to obtain for several reasons—the species ‘inaccessible habitat, the movement of bears across
international boundaries, and the costs of conducting surveys.”2

According to Dr. Susan Crockford, “out of the 13 populations for which some kind of data exist,
five populations are now classified by the PBSG [lUCN/SSC Polar Bear Specialist Group] as ‘stable'
(two more than 2009), one is still increasing, and three have been upgraded from ‘declining’ to ‘data
deficient ’. . . . That leaves four that are still considered ‘declining'-two of those judgments are based
primarily on concerns of overhunting, and one is based on a statistically insignificant decline that may
not be valid and is being reassessed (and really Should have been upgraded to ‘data deficient '). That
leaves only one population — Western Hudson Bay - where PBSG biologists tenaciously blame global
warming for all changes to polar bear biology, and even then, the data supporting that conclusion is
still not available. ”3

16. Some conclusions contradict and are ignorant of the best statistically valid
observations. For example, the Terrestrial Ecosystems Report states that “terrestrial and
freshwater ecosystems have sequestered about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted to the
atmosphere by human activities; in the past three decades (high confidence).” I have done
the first statistically valid estimate of carbon storage and uptake for any large area of
Earth’s land, the boreal forests and eastern deciduous forest of North America, and
subtropical forests in Queensland, Australia. The estimates of carbon uptake by vegetation
used by lPCC and in major articles cited by the reports are based on what can best be called
“grab samples," a relatively small number of studies done at a variety of times using a
variety of methods, mainly in old— growth areas. The results reported by IPCC overestimate

Page 142

carbon storage and uptake by as much as 300 percent.

17. The IPCC Report for Policymakers on Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability
repeats the assertion of previous IPCC reports that “large fraction of species” face
“increase extinction risks” (p15). Overwhelming evidence contradicts this assertion.
And it has been clearly shown that models used to make these forecasts, such as
climate envelope models and species—area curve models, make incorrect assumptions that
lead to erroneous conclusions, over—estimating extinction risks. Surprisingly few species
became extinct during the past 2.5 million years, a period encompassing several ice ages and
warm periods.5 Among other sources, this is based on information in the book Climate
Change and Biodiversity edited by Thomas Lovejoy, one of the leaders in the conservation
of biodiversity.6 The major species known to have gone extinct during this period are 40
species of large mammals in North America and Northern Europe. (There is a
“background” extinction rate for eukaryotic species of roughly one species per year.)

18. THE REPORTS GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT LIVING THINGS ARE

FRAGILE AND RIGID, unable to deal with change. The opposite is the case. Life is
persistent, adaptable, and adjustable.

19. STEADY-STATE ASSUMPTION: There is an overall assumption in the IPCC 2014
report and the White House Climate Change Assessment that all change is negative
and undesirable — that it is ecologically and evolutionarily unnatural, bad for
populations, species, ecosystems, for all life on planet Earth, including people. This is
the opposite of the reality. The environment has always changed and is always changing,

Page 143

and living things have had to adapt to these changes. Interestingly, many, if not most,
species that I have worked on or otherwise know about require environmental change.7

20. The IPCC Summary for Policy Makers on Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability
makes repeated use of the term “irreversible” changes. A species: going extinct is
irreversible, but little else about the environment is irreversible. The past confirms this.
Glaciers have come and gone repeatedly. The Northwest Passage of North America has
gone and come again. The average temperature has greatly exceeded the present and
forecasted and has declined only to rise again.

a. Implicit in this repeated use of irreversible is the belief that Earth’s environment is
constant — stable, unchanging — except when subjected to human actions. This is
obviously false from many lines of evidence, including the simple experience of all
people who have lived before the scientific—industrial age and those who live now
and so such work as farm, manage rivers, wildlife and forests.

The extreme over-emphasis on human-induced global warming has taken our
attention away from many environmental issues that used to be front and center but have
been pretty much ignored in the 21st century. By my count there are ten issues, including
global warming. I know it is easier for people to focus on just one issue at a time and ten seems
overwhelming, but they can all be part of, and can be cast in terms of, biodiversity and
sustainability. A singular focus on climate change as the driver of the other nine obscures the best
solutions to the full suite of environmental challenges we face. In terms of “the need to act now” it
is on these issues that we should focus. with the concern with a possible global warming prioritized
properly with that group.


Page 144

Environmental Issues that need our attention now

 

1. Energy
2. Fresh water
3. Habitat destruction
4. Invasive-species control
5. Direct threats to Endangered species
6. Pollution by directly toxic substances
7. fisheries
8. Forests
9. Phosphorus and other essential minerals

The Terrestrial report in a sense acknowledges this, for example by stating: “Climate stresses
occur alongside other anthropogenic influences on ecosystems, including land-use changes,
nonnative species, and pollution. and in many cases will exacerbate these pressures (very
high confidence). "

21. Do the problems with these reports mean that we can or should abandon any concerns
about global warming or abandon any research about it? Certainly not, but we need to
put this issue within an appropriate priority with other major here-and-now
environmental issues that are having immediate effects.

22. I reviewed and provided comments on both the IPCC 2014 report and the draft White House's
National Climatc Change Assessment and, unfortunately, it appears that these issues have not
been addressed in the final assessment. For example in regard to the White House Report, I
stated:

a. "The executive summary is a political statement, not a scientific statement. It is filled
with misstatements contradicted by well—established and well~known scientific papers."

b. "Climate has always affected people and all life on Earth, so it isn't new to say it is
'already affecting the American people} This is just a political statement."

Page 145

c. "it is inappropriate to use short-term changes in weather as an indication one way or
another about persistent climate change."

WHAT HAS GONE WRONG AND HOW TO fiX IT

1. Rather than focus on key, specific and tractable aspects of climate-change science, the
long-term approach throughout the 20th century was to try to create de nova a
complete model of the climate.

2. This approach has been taken despite a lack of focus on monitoring key variables over
time in statistically and scientifically valid ways, e.g. carbon sequestering by forests;
polar bear population counts. As a result, there is an odd disconnect between theory and
observation. The attempt to create complete models of every aspect of climate has meant
that many factors had to be guessed at, rather than using the best scientific methods. Too
many guesses, too little checking against real, observed effects.

3. Both reports are the result of a very large number of people doing long reviews of the
scientific literature. This easily leads to people being so overburdened that they
misinterpret specific papers, fail to understand where the major observational gaps are,
and have trouble making an accurate list of citations and all sources of information. The
fundamental lPCC and White House Climate Change Assessment approach has been to gather a
huge number of scientists from a large number of disciplines. on the assumption that a kind of
crowd approach to what can be agreed on is the same as true scientific advance While this might
seem a reasonable and effective approach, there is some danger in relying on this “crowdsourced”
model of information sharing. Groups of people, particularly when credentialed “experts“ are involved,
are very prone to a condition called an “information cascade” in which error is compounded by group

Page 146

think, assumptions become unchallenged “fact” and observations play second fiddle to unchallenged
models. The excellent scientists involved with the IPCC reports are no less prone to this than the
excellent scientists who relied on Aristotelian models of a geocentric universe. Entrenched beliefs are
hard to extricate, even amongst supposedly rational thinkers. This is probably in part responsible for
the problems listed with the White House Climate Assessment report’s table of Biological Effects,
discussed later.

4. What a scientist discovers is different from what a scientist says. The first is science,
the second is opinion. Have small groups of scientists work on this problem, no more than
can easily argue with one another, that is less than 20 and preferably even smaller,
representing the primary disciplines. Divide the problem into areas, rather than try to
answer all questions in one analysis. 1 have used this approach in my own work and found
it to be successful.8’ 9

5. The desire to do good has ironically overridden the desire to do the best science.

6. Under the weight of this kind of crowd rule and approach, some specific alternative
approaches to the science of climate change, have not been allowed to rise to the
surface.

7. Among the approaches that would improve climate science:

	1. Return to the former reliance on science done by individuals and small groups with a
	common specific interest and focus.

	2. Change the approach from trying to make a complete, definitive model of every
	aspect of climate to a different level. See kinds of models that explore specific
	possibilities and phenomena.

	3. Get out of the blame game. None of the above suggestions can work as long as

Page 147

global warming remains a moral, political, ideologically dominated topic, with
scientists pushed into, or at least viewed as, being either for or against a single point
of View.

9. We need to focus again on major environmental Issues that need our attention now
(see the list above).

10. ARE THERE EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF RESEARCH I BELIEVE WE NEED
MORE OF? YES.

a. NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS)
b. Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study
c. Whooping Crane monitoring, e.g. of an endangered species
d. In-place monitoring on carbon flux, being done by the USGS in the Great
   Cypress Swamp, florida.
e. Many others.

COMMENTS ON THE ASSESSMENT

GENERAL COMMENTS:

The opening statement of the Assessment (p. 1), reproduced here, is characteristic of the entire
Assessment in that it violates one of the basic principles of good climatology ——— never use short—
term weather changes as proof of climate change. Climatologists I have worked with over the
decades have said this repeatedly. In 1962, when I was a graduate student at the University of
Wisconsin working under a science writing fellowship, I spoke with Reed Bryson, said to be the
father of the International Geophysical Year and the person who persuaded Richard Keeling to
begin measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration on Manna Loa, Hawaii. At that time
Earth had been undergoing a global cooling since about 1940. At first Professor Bryson said “if
present trends continue, we are entering a new ice age.” But when I drafted a press release that
quoted him so, he thought about it carefully and told me that we could not make that statement,
because this was just a short— term weather event.

In the 1980s, I worked closely with Climatologist Stephen Schneider and we often gave
talks at the same events. Steve, one of the leaders of the modern concern about a possible
human—induced global warming, also said that you should never use short—term weather events
to infer climate change. I agreed with these experts, and therefore was taken aback by the
overall tone of the new White House Climate Change Assessment, which begins: “Climate
change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present. Corn
producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington State, and maple syrup producers in Vermont
are all observing climate related changes that are outside of recent experience. So, too, are
coastal planners in Florida, water managers in the arid Southwest, city dwellers from Phoenix to
New York, and Native Peoples on tribal lands from Louisiana to Alaska. This National Climate
Assessment concludes that the evidence of human—induced climate change continues to
strengthen and that impacts are increasing across the country.

Based on what my Climatologist colleagues had always told me, the Assessment should have
begun instead by stating: “Corn producers in Iowa, ovster growers in Washington State and
maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing weather-related changes ” outside of their

Page 150

personal recent experience. So, too, are coastal planners in florida, water managers in the arid
Southwest, city dwellers from Phoenix to New York, and Native peoples on tribal lands front
Louisiana to Alaska. “

The Assessment concludes that opening paragraph by stating: This National Climate
Assessment concludes that the evidence of human induced climate change continues to
strengthen and that impacts are increasing across the country.

Americans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter, and
extended periods of unusual heat last longer than any living American has ever experienced.
Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours. People are seeing
changes in the length and severity of seasonal allergies, the plant varieties that thrive in their
gardens, and the kinds of birds they see in any particular month in their neighborhoods (p.1).

These opening paragraphs and several that follow directly communicate to the
reader, both lay and professional, that human-induced global warming in an immediate
disaster. For example:

Other changes are even more dramatic. Residents of some coastal cities see their streets
flood more regularly during storms and high tides. Inland cities near large rivers also
experience more flooding, especially in the Midwest and Northeast. Insurance rates are rising in
some vulnerable locations, and insurance is no longer available in others, Hotter and drier
weather and earlier snowmelt mean that wildfires in the West start earlier in the spring, last
later into the fall, and burn more acreage. In Arctic Alaska, the summer sea ice that once
protected the coasts has receded, and autumn storms now cause more erosion, threatening many
communities with relocation.

Scientists who study climate change confirm that these observations are consistent with
significant changes in Earth ’s climatic trends. Long-term, independent records from weather
stations, satellites, ocean buoys, tide gauges, and many other data sources all confirm that our
nation, like the rest of the world, is warming. Precipitation patterns are changing, sea level is
rising, the oceans are becoming more acidic, and the frequency and intensity of some extreme
weather events are increasing (p. 1).

To be scientifically accurate, these paragraphs should instead have been written (my
changes noted by underlining): Other weather changes are even more dramatic. Residents of
some coastal cities see their streets flood more regularly during storms and high tides. Inland
cities near large rivers also experience more flooding, especially in the Midwest and Northeast.
Insurance rates are rising in some vulnerable locations, and insurance is no longer available in
others. Hotter and drier weather and earlier snowmelt mean that wildfires in the West start
earlier in the spring, last later into the fall, and burn more acreage. In Arctic Alaska, the
summer sea ice that once protected the coasts has receded, and autumn storms now cause more
erosion, threatening many communities with relocation. Scientists who study weather and
climate change point out that short—term, including several decades and longer, changes in
weather do not confirm that these observations are consistent with significant changes in Earth ’s
climatic trends.

These opening statements are directly followed by: Many lines of independent evidence

Page 151

demonstrate that the rapid warming of the past half-century is due primarily to human activities,
The observed warming and other climatic changes are triggering wide-ranging impacts in every
region of our country and throughout our economy. Some of these changes can be beneficial
over the short run, such as a longer growing season in some regions and a longer shipping
season on the Great Lakes. But many more are detrimental, largely because our society and its
infrastructure were designed for the climate that we have had, not the rapidly changing climate
we now have and can expect in the future. In addition, climate change does not occur in
isolation. Rather, it is superimposed on other stresses, which combine to create new challenges
(p. 1), The assertions in this paragraph are based on the forecasts from climate models and
from temperature records. However, figure 1 shows that the climate models greatly
exaggerate the rate and amount of temperature change and are not making forecasts that
come even close to fitting the data. Furthermore, figure 1 also shows that the average
Earth temperature in the past 30 years has changed very little if at all, contradicting the
assertions on the first page of the Assessment.

The Assessment further attributes the supposed climatic warming to human activities
that are releasing greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.
Therefore the claimed disaster is our fault. But recent evidence shows that temperature
change is not tracking the increase in carbon dioxide. The gas has increased from 370 ppm
to just over 400ppm, 8 percent, between year 2000 and year 2014 (figure 2), while the
temperature has changed either only slightly or not at all, depending on how one does the
analysis (figure 3). Instead, temperature change tracks closely changes in the energy output
from the sun (Soon, W. and D. R.  Legates, Solar irradiance modulationofEquator-to-
Pole(Arctic) temperaturegradients:EmpiricaIevidenceforclimate variationonmulti—
decadaltimescales. Journal of Atmospheric and Solar—Terrestrial Physics, 2013. 93: p. 45— 
56.)

Figure 2. Mauna Loa Observatory C02 measurements
<see orignal document for figure>

 
Page 152

figure 3. Earth Surface Temperature Departure from 1950-1980 Average

The current evidence from scientific observations shows that Earth’s temperature has not
changed very much, if at all, since the start of the new century, while carbon dioxide has
increased considerably.

Given these facts, the basic opening assertions of the new U.S. Climate Change
Assessment are about a hypothetical world, not a real world, and must be taken as a “what
it” rather than “what is". Therefore the dire consequences forecast in the Assessment
cannot be taken as reliable, nullifying many, if not most, of the ecological and biological
implications the Assessment makes heavy use of.

The time available to write and the space available to publish as written testimony
prevent a comprehensive, detailed review of the entire White House Climate Change
Assessment. As a result, I have used as an example of the kinds of problems throughout the
Assessment the table appearing on pages 204—5, Biological Responses To climate Change. As an
ecologist, l have taken that table and reorganized it. This reorganization follows.

Although the document is titled “Climate Change Assessment,” the term “climate
change” is not defined and is in fact used with two meanings, natural and human-induced. There
are places in the Assessment where only the second meaning makes sense, so that meaning has
to be assumed. There are other places where either meaning could be applied. In those places
where either meaning can be interpreted, if the statement is assumed to be a natural change, then
it is a truism, a basic characteristic of Earth’s environment and something people have always
known and experienced. If the meaning is taken to be human—caused, then in spite of the
assertions in the Assessment, the available data do not support the statements.

For example, the Assessment‘s section titled CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE begins with the statement: Climate change, once considered an issue for a
distant future, has moved firmly into the present. Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in

Page 153

Washington State, and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related
changes that are outside of recent experience.

If this is to be interpreted as natural, then people have frequently in history experienced
“climate-related changes that are outside of [their] recent experiences," as the Medieval

Warming and Little Ice Age demonstrate,(2,3,4) and therefore it is not unusual nor unexpected
in ordinary life. If this is to be interpreted to be human-induced, then the evidence just discussed
demonstrates that this kind of change cannot be attributed to human actions and therefore the
statement is false.

ANALYSIS OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ASSESSMENT TABLE OF
ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS, titled Biological responses to climate change
(Assessment’s pages 204-205)

The Assessment presents a list of 30 biological responses to climate change. Since this is my
particular area of expertise, I have analyzed this list and sorted the items into the following
categories: Where the Assessment is wrong based on my understanding (10 items);
Improvements (12 items); Declines (which can be taken as worsening) (No items); Predicted
from Climate Models, Therefore Not Fact, especially given the failure of climate models to
forecast with any reliability Earth’s increase in temperature since the 1990s (see figure 1) (3
items); and Unlikely or Unsupported Statement (5 items). Within the context of the
Assessment, this table comes across as meaning to demonstrate more very negative effects
of a human-induced global warming, but since upon analysis none of the 30 appears to be
a legitimately supported decline that might occur under a hypothetical global warming or
have been directly observed, this table in fact is an argument against the overall message of
the Assessment.

(The number that appears at the beginning of each entry is the number in the Assessment's list.
The numbers following each of the Assessment’s entry are the citation number as listed in the
Assessment. The Assessment‘s statements are in italics; my comments appear in plain font.)

ASSESSMENT IS WRONG

1. 21. Seedling survival of nearly 20 resident and migrant tree species decreased during
years of lower rainfall in the Southern Appalachians and the Piedmont areas, indicating
that reductions in native species and limited replacement by invading species were likely
under climate change. 134 Since the climate models are admittedly weak about changes
in rainfall, this statement has no relevance to purported human—induced global warming.

2. 27. Water temperature data and observations of migration behaviors over a 34-year time
Period showed that adult pink salmon migrated earlier into Alaskan Creeks, and fry
advanced the tinting of migration out to sea. Shifts in migration timing may increase the
potential for a mismatch in optimal environmental conditions for early life stages, and
continued warming trends will likely increase pre-spawning mortality and egg mortality
rates.87 Salmon have evolved and are adapted to environmental change.

3. 3. Conifers in many western forests have experienced mortality rates of up to 87% from
warming-induced changes in the prevalence of pests and pathogens and stress from
drought.118 Important causes of the mortality of trees in western forests are: fire
suppression, which promotes insect and disease outbreaks, and from introduced

Page 154

(invasive) insects and diseases.

4. 8. Warmer and drier conditions during the early growing season in high-elevation
habitats in Colorado are disrupting the timing of various flowering patterns, with
potential impacts on many important plant—pollinator relationships. 77 “Disrupting " is
a politically loaded term. The scientific term would be “changed” and this is a good
sign, showing the adaptability of species to changing environments.

5. 12. Variation in the timing and magnitude of precipitation due to climate change was
found to decrease the nutritional quality of grasses, and consequently reduce weight gain
of bison in the Konza Prairie in Kansas and the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in
Oklahoma] 24, Results provide insight into how climate change will affect grazer
population dynamics in the future. This is stated in a way that is not open to scientific
evaluation. No doubt lower rainfall has negative effects, but the statement is “variation.”

In fact, the publication cited (Craine et al., 2008)5 states that “Greater late summer
precipitation increased bison weight gain . . . “greater midsummer precipitation decreased
weight gain.” This is a scientifically interesting result for those focused on wildlife in
grasslands, but it is neither a negative nor positive in terms of global warming, because
the forecasting models are weakest in forecasting rainfall even annually, let alone
seasonally. Therefore these results cannot be taken as negative (nor positive) effects of a
global rise in average temperature.

6. 10. Cutthroat trout populations in the western US. are projected to decline by up to
58%, and total trout habitat in the same region is projected to decline by 47%, due to
increasing temperatures, seasonal shifts in precipitation, and negative interactions with
nonnative species. 8. Stresses on Cutthroat extend considerably beyond Climate change
and have to do with fishing intensity, water diversions and other habitat changes, such as
competition from introduced, invasive species such as lake trout and rainbow trout.6

7. 28. Warmer springs in Alaska have caused earlier onset of plant emergence, and
decreased spatial variation in growth and availability of forage to breeding caribou. This
ultimately reduced calving success in caribou populations.138 The implication is that
warming will necessarily have a negative effect on caribou, but the paper cited (Post ct
al., 2008) actually is much more cautious, stating “it is highly relevant to herbivore.
ecology to consider the manner in which warming will alter spatial patterns of plant
phenology at more immediate spatial scales than that of the regional landscape. The
paper concludes, cautiously: “ Large herbivores prefer newly emergent forage,
presumably owing to the high digestibility and nutrient content of young plant tissues . . .
future warming could conceivably impair the ability of herbivores such as caribou to
forage selectively, with adverse consequences for their productivity. We suggest,
therefore, that it is highly relevant to herbivore ecology to consider the manner in which
warming will alter spatial patterns of plant phenology at more immediate spatial scales
than that of the regional landscape.”7

There is again an inherent assumption that a steady-state between living things
and climate is natural and necessary for a species’ persistent. Wildlife population can
and do adjust to changes, but this can take some time. See the examples of current
adjustments, which i have added below this table. Give the populations at little time to
adjust.

8. 26 Changes in female polar bear reproductive success (decreased litter mass and
numbers of yearlings) along the north Alaska coast have been linked to changes in body
size and/or body condition following years with lower (availability of optimal sea ice
habitat. 137. There is evidence that polar bears are adjusting by feeding more on
terrestrial prey. Contrary to the publicity about polar bears, there is little information
demonstrating any statistically, scientifically valid decline in polar bear populations, 1
have sought the available counts of the 19 subpopulations. Of these, only three have been
counted twice; the rest have been counted once. Thus no rate of change in the population
is possible. The first count was done 1986 for one subpopulation.8

9. 7. Quaking aspen—dominated systems are experiencing declines in the western US, after
stress due to climate induced drought conditions during the last decade, 122 Anderegg,
W. R. L., J. M. Kane, and L. D. Li Anderegg, 2012: Consequences of widespread tree
mortality triggered by drought and temperature stress. Nature Climate Change, 3, 30-36,
doi:10.1038/nclimate1635. Given the failure of the climate models to predict
temperature change and the observed lack of a significant recent rise in temperature, it is
incorrect to refer to this as a “climate induced’ drought. Moreover, a thousand year tree—
ring study shows that deep droughts are characteristic of California. Meteorologist
Martin P. Hoerling wrote on March 8, 2014 that “At present, the scientific evidence does
not support an argument that the drought there is appreciably linked to human—induced
Climate change.” Hoerling is a research meteorologist, specializing in climate dynamics,
at the Earth System Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the White House's National Climate Assessment cites many of
Hoerling’s papers, including figure 20.4 “Longer Frost-free Season Increases Stress on
Crops,” so his work is respected by the authors.

10. 9. Population fragmentation of wolverines in the northern Cascades and Rocky
Mountains is expected to increase as spring snow cover retreats overt/1c coming

centuryJZ3 The paper cited, Dawson et al. (20l l)9, does not mention wolverines. And
contrary to making a highly negative statement, the paper states Populations of many
species have persisted in situ at individual sites since the last glacial maximum
(toleration) and many have undergone habitat shifts, moving short distances (1 to 10 km)
to sites with different aspects, slopes, elevations. and other attributes as the environment
changed. Migrations of100 to 1000 km are well documented for many species

IMPROVEMENTS

1. 2. Northern flickers arrived at breeding sites earlier in the Northwest in response to
temperature changes along migration routes, and egg laying advanced by 1.15 days for
every degree increase in temperature, demonstrating that this species has the capacity to
adjust their phenology in response to climate change] I 7

2. 11.Comparisons of historical and recent first flowering dates for 178 plant species from
North Dakota showed significant shifts occurred in over 40% of species examined, with
the greatest changes observed during the two warmest years of the study. 75

3. 14. Migratory birds monitored in Minnesota over a 40-year period showed significantly
earlier arrival dates, particularly in short-distance migrants, indicating that some
species are capable of responding to increasing winter temperatures better than


Page 156

others. 

4. 15. Up to 50% turnover in amphibian species is projected in the eastern US. by 2100,
including the northern leopard frog, which is projected to experience poleward and
elevational range shifts in response to climatic changes in the latter quarter of the
century. 127

5. 16. Studies of black ratsnake (Elaphe obsoleta) populations at different latitudes in
Canada, Illinois, and Texas suggest that snake populations, particularly in the northern
part of their range. could benefit from rising temperatures if there are no negative
impacts on their habitat and prey. 128

6. 17. Warming-induced hybridization was detected between southern and northern flying
squirrels in the Great Lakes region of Ontario, Canada, and in Pennsylvania after a
series of warm winters created more overlap in their habitat ran ge, potentially acting to
increase population persistence under climate change.129

7. 18. Some warm—water fishes have moved northwards, and some tropical and subtropical
fishes in the northern Gulf ofMexico have increased in temperate ocean habitat. 130
Similar shifts and invasions have been documented in Long Island Sound and
Narragansett Bay in the Atlantic.131

8. 23. Over the last 130 years (1880—2010), native bees have advanced their spring arrival
in the northeastern US. by an average of 10 days, primarily due to increased warming.
Plants have also showed a trend of earlier blooming, thus helping preserve the synchrony
in timing between plants and pollinators. 135

9. 24. In the Northwest Atlantic, 24 out of 36 commercially exploited fish stocks showed
significant range (latitudinal and depth) shifts between 1968 and 2007 in response to
increased sea surface and bottom temperatures.55

10. 25. Increases in maximum, and decreases in the mutual variability of} sea surface
temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean have promoted growth of small phytoplankton
and led to a reorganization in the species composition of primary (phytoplankton) and
secondary (zooplankton) producers. 136

11. 29. Many Hawaiian mountain vegetation types were found to vary in their sensitivity to
changes in moisture availability; consequently. climate change will likely influence
elevation-related vegetation patterns in this region.139

12. 5. In response to climate-related habitat change, many small mammal species have
altered their elevation ranges, with lower-elevation species expanding their ranges and
higher»elevation species contracting their ranges. 120

DECLINES

None.

PREDICTED FROM CLIMATE MODELS, THEREFORE NOT FACT

1. 30. Sea level is predicted to rise by 1.6 to 3.3 feet in Hawaiian waters by 2100. consistent
with global projections of l to 4 feet of sea level rise (sec Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate.
Key Message 10). This is projected to increase wave heights, the duration of turbidity,
and the amount of re-suspended sediment in the water; consequently, this will create
potentially stressful conditions for coral reef communities. 140

2. 6. Northern spotted owl populations in Arizona and New Mexico are projected to decline

Page 157

during the next century and are at high risk for extinction due to hotter. drier conditions,
while the southern California population is not projected to be sensitive to future climatic
changes. 121

3. 19. Global marine mammal diversity is projected to decline at lower latitudes and
increase at higher latitudes due to changes in temperatures and sea ice, with complete
loss of optimal habitat for as many as 1 1 species by midcentury; seal populations living
in tropical and temperate waters are particularly at risk to future declines.132

UNLIKELY CORRELATION 0R UNSUPPORTED STATEMENT

1. 13. (a and b) Climatic fluctuations were found to influence mate selection and increase
the probability of infidelity in birds that are normally socially monogamous, increasing
the gene exchange and the likelihood of offspring survival. 125

2. 20. Higher nighttime temperatures and cumulative seasonal rainfalls were correlated with
changes in the arrival times of amphibians to wetland breeding sites in South Carolina
over a 30-year time period (1978~2008). 133 Of course. The time period precedes any
possible effect of human-induced global warming, and the effect is a truism. Rainfall
will affect amphibians. Since the climate models are admittedly weak about changes in
rainfall, this statement has no relevance to purported human—induced global warming.

3. 22. Widespread declines in body size of resident and migrant birds at a bird-banding
station in western Pennsylvania were documented over a 40-year period; body sizes of
breeding adults were negatively correlated with mean regional temperatures from the
preceding year.85 The citation for this statement is NatureServe, cited 2012: Ecosystem-
based Management Tools Network. [Available online at www.cbmtools.org i. This is a
general website. 1 used its search option and did not find bird-banding nor Pennsylvania,
nor any reference to a study of bird-banding in Pennsylvania.

4. 4. Butterflies that have adapted to specific oak species have not been able to colonize
new tree species when climate change-induced tree migration changes local forest types,
potentially hindering adaptation. 119 . The citation 119 in the Assessment is Aumen, N.,

I searched this report and found no mention of butterflies. This is probably an
inadvertent editing error and the authors of the Assessment meant to refer to some other
paper, but since this is the actual listing, the statement is unsupported.

5. 1. Mussel and barnacle beds have declined or disappeared along ports of the Northwest
coast due to higher temperatures and drier conditions that have compressed habitable
intertidal space] I 6. The citation listed is Burke, L., L. Reytar, M. Spalding, and A.
Perry. 201 1: Reefs at Risk Revisited. World Resources Institute, 130 pp. [Available
online at httn://pdf.wri.ora/rcefs at risk revisited.pdf]. I searched this citation and did
not find any mention of the words mussel or barnacle and the only mention of
“northwest” was “northwestern Hawaii.” Again this is likely a typographic error, but no
other statement in the Assessment brought me to a relevant paper either, so the statement

Page 158

is unsupported by the report.

SOME OTHER EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC STATEMENTS THAT ARE INCORRECT,
OR OVERSTATED, OR LIMITED TO A FEW SPECIfiC CASES, OR OTHERWISE OF
DOUBTFUL GENERALITY

Given the length of the just-released White House Climate Change Assessment and the
time available to review it, I am able to consider only a few examples of other specific
problems with the Assessment. I have focused on those that have to do with biological
factors. These, however, are representative of problems throughout the Assessment. (Once
again, the material in italics is quotes from the Assessment; the material in standard font is my
text.)

Cores from corals, ocean sediments, ice records, and other indirect temperature measurements
indicate the recent rapid increase of ocean temperature is the greatest that has occurred in at
least the past millennium and can only be reproduced by climate models with the inclusion of
human-caused sources of heat—trapping gas emissions (p. 559). As we saw earlier, the climate
models are not coming even close to forecasting air temperature change, and therefore could not
be expected to forecast accurately changes in ocean temperature, so it is not correct to say that
something "can only be reproduced by climate models with the inclusion of human-caused
sources of heat-trapping gas emissions."

Warmer air and ocean temperatures are also causing the continued, dramatic decline in Arctic
sea ice during the summer (panel D) (p. 560). We published a paper comparing Arctic sea ice
extent in the nineteenth century, using historical records from ships hunting the bowhead whale,
with those in recent times.[10] In this paper we wrote, “Records from May indicate that
end—of—winter sea-ice extent in the Bering Sea during the mid-l9th century closely resembled
that in the 1972—82 data. However, the historical data reveal that sea ice was more extensive
during summer, with the greatest difference occurring in July. This pattern indicates a later and
more rapid seasonal retreat.” While the statement in the White House Climate Change
Assessment is not contradicted by our paper, the limited statement (about the summer) in the
Assessment once again paints a dire picture to the average reader, whereas our work suggests
that in fact the sea ice extent recovered over winter, and changes in arctic sea ice are more
complicated than the Assessment implies. The problem here is a matter of tone and
communication.

Key Message 4: Seasonal Patterns: Timing of critical biological events»-——such as spring bud
burst, emergence from overwintering, and the start of migrations—41m shifted, leading to
important impacts on species and habitats (p.201). The implication here is that this is entirely
negative for life on Earth and will forever be so. But on the contrary, the environment has always
changed and is always changing, and living things have had to adapt to these changes.
interestingly, many, if not most, species that I have worked on or otherwise know about require
environmental change, including salmon and sequoia trees.[11,12]

Page 159

Two of the longest studies of animals and plants in Great Britain show that at least some
species are adjusting to recent weather changes in “timing of critical biological events, such as
spring bud burst, emergence from overwintering.” For example, a 47-year study of the bird
Pants major (one of the longest monitoring of any bird species) shows that these birds are
responding behaviorally to recent weather changes. A species of caterpillar that is one of the
main foods of this bird during egg-laying has been emerging earlier as spring temperatures have
risen. In response, females of this bird species are laying their eggs an average of two weeks 
earlier.[13]

The second study, one of the longest experiments about how vegetation responds to
temperature and rainfall, shows that long-lived small grasses and sedges are highly resistant to
climate change. The authors of the study report that changes in temperature and rainfall during
the past 13 years “have had little effect on vegetation structure and physiognomy.”[14]

Of course with any environmental change, not all species will do well. This has always
been the case, and is consistent with Darwinian evolution and with ecological knowledge. Black
guillemots (Cepphus grylle), birds that nest on Cooper Island, Alaska, illustrate that some
species are having difficulties adjusting to climate change. (However, black guillemots in their
entire range are not a threatened or endangered species. It is only their abundance on Cooper
Island that has declined.)

The problem has been that temperature increases in the 1990s caused the sea ice to
recede farther from the island each spring, The parent birds feed on Arctic cod found under the
sea ice and must then return to the nest to feed their chicks, who are not yet mature enough to
survive on their own. For the parents to do this, the distance from feeding grounds to nest must
be less than about 30 km, but in recent years the ice in the spring has been receding as much as
500—800 km (300—500 mi) from the island. As a result, the black guillemots on the island have
lost an important source of food. The birds have sometimes targeted sculpin, which is not as
abundant as cod.15

But the real problem these Cooper Island birds face today is egg predation by polar bears.
With less sea ice during this time period, bears have gone ashore and eaten young birds. In 2009,
of the 180 guillemots that hatched, only one on the island fledged (flew away).The solution to
this has been to build bear—proof nesting boxes for the birds. In 2O1O, bear proof nesting boxes
resulted in about 100 birds that fledged.

Two points emerge here. One is that living things do in fact often adjust to changes in
the timing of climate events; if not, there would be little or no life on Earth. The second is that
the real problem black guillemots face is here—and-now predation, which can be and has been
dealt with and does not require a single focus on whether or not the climate change was human—
induced.

Chapter 7, Forests, opens with this:

Key Messages

1. Climate change is increasing the vulnerability of many forests to ecosystem changes and tree
mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought, and disease outbreaks.

As I noted before, the Assessment suffers from the use of the term “climate change” with two
meanings: natural and human—induced. The implication in this key message is that the forest
problems are the result of human-induced climate change, but as I have made clear, both the

Page 160

failure of the models and the failure of temperature change to closely track C02 make this key
statement false. Furthermore, it is well known that (1) forest wildfires are largely due to long-
term suppression of fires in the twentieth century, which allowed the buildup of excessive fuel;
and (2) that insect infestations and disease outbreaks are heavily the result of introduced species
and the failure to remove dead and decaying timber from forests. In addition, this key statement
is another example where recent weather patterns are said to represent and prove human—induced
global warming. which I pointed out at the beginning is incorrect.

Key Message 2. U. S. forests and associated wood products currently absorb and store the
equivalent of about 16% of all carbon dioxide (C02) emitted by fossil fuel burning in the US.
each year. Climate change, combined with current societal trends in land use and forest
management, is projected to reduce this rate of forest C02 uptake.

As explained in my review of the IPCC 2014 report, the estimates of carbon uptake by
vegetation used by IPCC and in major articles cited by the reports are based on what can best be
called “grab samples,” a relatively small number of studies done at a variety of times using a
variety of methods, mainly in old-growth areas. The results reported by IPCC overestimate
carbon storage and uptake by as much as 300%. 16 Therefore this is an unreliable statement.

As I stated at above, these are representative examples of problems that exist throughout the
Climate Change Assessment.

Responses by Daniel Botkin to Additional Questions

Environment and Public Works Committee Hearing June 18, 2014
Follow-up Questions for Written Submission

To: Senators Barbara Boxer, Chairman, and David Vitter. Rankinq Member.
Environment and Public Works Committee.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify at this Senate hearing. Since the topic of the
hearing, “Climate Change: The Need to Act Now," concerned a scientific topic and the
application of science to policy, and since I was the only professional scientist testifying
at the hearing, and since there was, as a result, a question as to who is a scientific
expert, I would like to add the following information to the record, with the hope that this
will be useful to the Committee in its future consideration of this important question.

I come to you as a scientist, not a politician, not as a member of a specific
political party (I vote as an independent). My doctorate is in biology (Rutgers University
1968) and since 1968 I have done research on the theory of global warming and its
possible ecological effects. I would like to put into the record a list of my scientific
publications that have dealt with many aspects of this topic, as follows:

Questions for Botkin Questions from: Senator David Vitter

1.

Will the Existing Source Performance Standard rule as currently
constructed have a measurable effect on global average temperatures, sea level
rise, the extent of sea ice, or the severity or frequency of hurricanes, tornados,

Page 169

droughts, or floods?

If the United States acts alone, the scientific estimates I have read indicate that
this will have very little effect on the average temperature and therefore on these other
factors if the rest of the nations of the world continue to emit as much carbon dioxide as
they are at present and as forecast they will release in the future. More important, as I
show in my testimony, the forecasts from the global climate models do not correspond
at all to recent and current temperature trends, but instead vastly overestimate the
changes. If this lack of correlation continues, then temperatures will not increase at
anywhere near the rate forecast by the climate models from greenhouse gases, and
therefore will this reduction by the US. would have little effect on the climate.

2. Dr. Botkin, you served as an expert reviewer for both the recent IPCC
report as well as the White House Climate Assessment. Did you find either
process responsive to reviewer comments?

No, to my knowledge neither process was responsive to any of my comments as
a reviewer.

Questions from: Senator Jeff Sessions

1. Your testimony did an excellent job of highlighting the risks of reliance
upon the IPCC 2014 Assessment and the National Climate Change Assessment
for major policy decisions.

The four EPA Administrators who testified at the hearing wrote an op-ed last
year that says "There is no longer any credible scientific debate about the basic
facts" and “delay could mean that warming becomes ‘locked in!" Do you believe
that there is still scientific debate about the extent to which human greenhouse
gas emissions affect the climate? And how do you respond to the claim that
"delay could mean that warming becomes ‘locked in?”

Regarding whether there is a scientific debate: Yes, there is still a legitimate
scientific debate about the extent to which greenhouse gas emissions are affecting
Earth’s climate. It is well known that carbon dioxide, methane, and some other gases
absorb specific wavelengths of infrared light, which is informally known as heat
radiation, and therefore function as “greenhouse gases," the term usually used
informally. On a planet like Mars or Venus, without life, without water in its three phases
— gas, liquid, and solid —— and without plate tectonics, and with an atmosphere
composed largely of carbon dioxide, this gas has a major effect on that planet’s climate.
But on Earth the situation is much more complicated, because water vapor is the
primary greenhouse gas, because water is continually passing from vapor to condensed
(liquid) water in the atmosphere in ways that are extremely complex, passing from liquid
to ice and back again in the oceans and on the land also in extremely complex patterns,
and because life on Earth affects climate in many ways. The four principal ways that

Page 170

living things affect climate are (1) through evaporation and uptake (condensation) of
water, (2) exchange of other trace gases including greenhouse gases. (3) changing the
reflectance of large surface areas of Earth, and (4) changing the roughness index (the
way that winds at and near the surface are slowed by the surface).

As I have written in various scientific papers since the 1970s, the result is a
global life-supporting and life—containing system that we only partially understand (see
my attached list of climate—change—related publications). It is arrogant of us to claim that
we understand this incredibly complex system to the extent that we can make firm
forecasts, especially given the current failure of climate models to forecast recent
temperature changes. To paraphrase the famous thinker Buckminster Fuller, we are
born onto a planet that did not come with an instruction manual.

In short, we don’t fully understand how our planet’s life supporting system works,
and our difficult but fascinating scientific investigation is still in its very early stages.
How unfortunate, then, that how Earth’s climate works has been turned into a political
debate that assumes we know all we need to know about it to make decisions that will
have many large scale effects.

At the hearing. the statement was made repeatedly by the four EPA
administrators that 97% of scientists agreed that human—caused global warming was
happening I would like to clarify the basis for that assertion and what the facts actually
are as discussed in the paper “Climate Consensus and ‘Misinformation’: A Rejoinder to
Agnotology, Scientific Consensus, and the Teaching and Learning of Climate Change.”[1]
This paper reanalyzes the basis for the statement that 97% of scientists agree that our
addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is causing a major global warming and
concludes “Inspection of a claim by Cook et al. (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of
97.1 % consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3%
endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is
anthropogenic.” it is not 97% of scientists that agree about global warming, but less
than 1%, according to this paper.

None of the four EPA administrators are scientists. They were simply repeating
the standard assertions that are made, which, as l discussed, are an inaccurate
assessment of what scientists in general believe to be the case. But most important.
science is not a majority—rule process. it is an analysis based on what the facts show.
There are many cases in the history of science those in political and ideological control
strongly opposed findings by scientists, with very negative results. Two obvious
examples are Galileo and the Pope; and in the USSR, centralized political control over
genetics and agriculture by Trofim Lysenko, the director of the Soviet Union's Lenin
All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Lysenkoism. “Lysenkoism” was a theory
that acquired characteristics could be inherited. For example, if you cut off the tales of
rats, their offspring would lack tales. Even though it departed completely from the then

Scientific Consensus, and the Teaching and Learning of Climate Change, Science &
Education. (10.1007/511191-013—9647—9) August 2013,

Page 171

and now well-accepted Darwinian evolutionary theory, Lysenkoism was the required
rule in the Soviet Union and Darwinian evolution was suppressed, greatly damaging
biological research in the Soviet Union.

In a democracy with freedom of speech, scientific findings must speak
themselves, not drawn out by the repeated mouthings of half-truths by nonscientists.

For those not familiar with the bases of the scientific method, i recommend
chapter 2 in my textbook with Professor Edward A. Keller, Environmental Science: Earth
as a Living Planet.

Regarding whether "delay could mean that warming becomes ‘Locked in’ there
are two problems with this assertion. first, carbon dioxide has varied greatly over the
geological ages and has never gotten permanently “locked into” a specific concentration
in the atmosphere. The same can be said for Earth’s average temperature.

Second, such a statement arises from a specific kind of theory about the climate
as a system, a theory that assumes climate without human action achieves and remains
at a steady state, at a constant concentration. To the contrary, well—accepted findings
from such research as the Antarctic Ice Cores show that the climate has always
changed, has never been in a steady-state. it is therefore a non-steady—state system,
and a theory it to be steady—state is bound to be wrong in general and in many specific
ways. This is also a point l have made repeatedly in my scientific papers.

Steady-state systems, like the Empire State Building, remain in a constant
condition unless tipped too far. This is what lies behind claims that the climate may be
at or near a “tipping point." Earth’s climate is inherently non-steady-state and it is an
incorrect description of such a system to claim that something like the concentration of a
greenhouse gas or Earth’s temperature could be “locked-in.”

Put more simply, how Earth’s biosphere (the global life-containing and life-
supporting system) is just beginning to be understood, and there are. of course, many
different theoretical approaches to explain how this system works. At present we do not
know enough to make claims about whether any of Earth’s systems could be definitely
characterized as having “tipping points,” and especially whether any aspect of the
climate is about to be “locked in."

2. During the hearing, you sought to comment on assertions that linked sea
level rise to C02 emissions. Could you elaborate for the record upon sea level rise
in general and correlation with CO2 emissions? Please provide any charts, data
sets, or peer—reviewed papers you feel relevant.

Let me make clear first of all that my primary research has been on terrestrial
ecosystems and my speciality is not oceanography. Measurements of sea level rise are
themselves difficult and subject to scientific questions about consistency over time and
location, and experts in this field are actively discussing whether there has been an
increase in the rate of sea level rise during the twentieth century. Forecasting how sea
level will rise in the future is even more difficult and uncertain and is a major subject of
current research. For example, a major scientific paper concerning sea level rise stated
that “Uncertainties in sea—level projections for the 21st century have focused ice sheet

Page 172

modelling efforts to include the processes that are thought to be contributing to the
recently observed rapid changes at ice sheet margins. This effort is still in its infancy,
however, leaving us unable to make reliable predictions of ice sheet responses to a
warming climate if such glacier accelerations were to increase in size and frequency.”

Reconstructions of past sea—level rise show considerable variation of the past
17,000 years, depending on the rate at which glaciers melted, and this poses a problem
beyond my expertise for forecasting changes today into the future.3

I am not expert enough about this subject to comment further, except to point out
the following: Several things about sea level are well known and well accepted relating
to this question of sea level rise and CO2 emissions. Most important, sea level has
been rising since the end of the last ice age, approximately 12,500 years ago. This is
so well known that even a book for lay people about environmental problems in Venice,
Italy, The Science of Saving Venice,‘ states that “during the last great ice age, the
landscape [of Venice} was very different. The sea was 100 meters lower than it is today
. . . the seas rose as the ice age ended," The standard estimate is that as a result of
the natural melting of the continental glaciers and natural warming trend since the end
of that last ice age, the sea level has risen approximately one to two feet a century.
Many discussions of sea level rise and CO2 concentration ignore this natural process
and present the situation as if all sea level rise was the result of human activities that
are increasing the concentration of this gas in the atmosphere. On the contrary, effects
of our additions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is in addition to the background
natural rate of sea level rise.

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Next, we will hear from Attorney General 
Strange. Welcome, Attorney General. 

STATEMENT OF HON. LUTHER STRANGE, ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, STATE OF ALABAMA 

Mr. STRANGE. Thank, Mr. Chairman, Senator Sessions and mem-
bers of the committee for having me here today. I am pleased to 
be here to share my thoughts. 

As the Attorney General of Alabama, it is my sworn duty to up-
hold the rule of law for the almost 5 million people that we have 
in my State. That duty includes enforcing the environmental laws 
that help protect our natural resources and the health of our citi-
zens. 

One of the most important matters I am involved with now as 
attorney general is serving as the coordinating counsel for the Gulf 
States in the historic BP oil spill litigation. Alabama’s coastline 
was covered in oil and our economy was shut down for months as 
a result of the spill. 

I understand firsthand manmade environmental disasters and 
the importance of sensible and effective environmental regulations. 
With that said, my comments today reflect a continuing concern 
with this Administration’s approach to environmental regulation. 
The defense of this proposal will be that the States have ‘‘flexi-
bility.’’ Providing the States with a narrow range of costly policy 
choices, which most of the States did not choose for themselves, 
does not provide any actual flexibility and still produces the same 
outcome—higher electricity prices and decreased generation. 
Repeating over and over again the word ‘‘flexibility’’ is not an 
adequate defense or an adequate answer to the low income con-
sumers in my State or any other State, for that matter, who will 
ask why they must pay more to reduce CO2 emissions when those 
reductions cannot and will not impact the global climate. 
Congress did not intend for the Clean Air Act, Section 111(d) to 
have such a far reaching consequence for the American people. In-
deed, to prevent impacts such as those that will flow from EPA’s 
proposed emission guidelines, Congress took care to limit EPA’s au-
thority under Section 111(d). 

Given the enormous burdens that would be imposed by EPA’s 
proposed guidelines, however, it may be obvious that EPA has sim-
ply disregarded the limits of the law. These limits, moreover, are 
not questionable or controversial. They are expressed in clear ele-
ments of the Clean Air Act. 

First, the Clean Air Act forbids regulating sources under Section 
111(d) if they are regulated under Section 112 of the Act. Existing 
electric utility generating units are regulated under Section 112. 
Second, the Clean Air Act also forbids Section 111(d) regulations 
based on emission reductions that cannot be achieved at individual 
facilities but instead rely on reductions that require actions by an 
entire system. EPA’s proposed emission guidelines fully embrace a

Act and in the unquestionable jurisdiction of States over intraState

“CLIMATE CHANGE: THE NEED 10 ACT Now”
SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT & PUBLIC WORKS
SUBCOMMITTEE 0N CLEAN AIR AND NUCLEAR SAFETY
JUNE 18, 2014

Testimony of Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange

Good morning, Chairwoman Boxer, Ranking Member Vitter, Subcommittee Chairman
Whitehouse, Ranking Member Sessions, and Members of the Committee. Thank you inviting
me to testify here today. My name is Luther Strange, and I am the Attorney General of
Alabama. As Attorney General, my sworn duty is to uphold the rule of law for the 4.8 million
hardworking men and women in my state. That duty includes enforcing the environmental laws
which help protect our natural resources and the health of our citizens. My comments today
reflect a continuing concern with this Administration’s approach to environmental regulation.
EPA’s proposed guidelines for existing power plant performance standards under Clean Air Act
section 111(d) are simply the most recent example of the Federal Government usurping
authorities properly delegated to the States.

Like electric suppliers all over the country, municipalities, cooperatives and investor-
owned utilities in Alabama are trying to come to grips with what this proposal will mean to
families and businesses in my state. Ultimately, someone has to pay for changing the way we
produce and use energy. If anyone suggests that these costs are minimal or worth it because of
the example that the United States will set, I would point out that setting an example in this
instance cannot by definition be free or cheap. On its face, the Administration’s proposal would
force electric suppliers to: 1) spend more for efficiency projects that are not economic, 2) deploy
renewable energy projects that do not meet normal cost-benefit standards, 3) limit the amount of
electricity used by customers through demand management efforts that do not meet standard cost
tests. 4) operate gas plants out of economic order in a way that was never envisioned before the
proposal, and 5) deny consumers access to lower cost coal plants—that were paid for through
current low rates—in ways that no one ever envisioned before the proposal.

The proposal goes to great lengths to disguise or minimize the negative economic, social,
and reliability impacts that it will have. Even the Administration’s own estimates, however, are
shocking-65,000 megawatts of generation will be closed prematurely; 6,000 megawatts will
close in my region; annual compliance costs will be between $7.5 billion and $9 billion and
rising; southern region electric prices will increase by 3.4 percent by 2020 and nationwide by 6.5
percent. Recent history, moreover, has shown that EPA is likely to have underestimated these
already severe impacts. During the MATS rulemaking, for instance, EPA told the nation that
only 5,000 megawatts of coal-fired electric generation would be retired. Ten times that amount
has been announced—some 50,000 megawatts. To put this in perspective, between the MATS
actual impact and EPA’s low ball assessment of this proposal, America will shutter generation
resources that exceed the electricity output of the entire nation of Spain. Early forced closure of
existing generation has to have cost impacts—low-cost generation is closed, more costly
generation remains, and customers must pay more for electricity. The result is inescapable and
intended. Even the President acknowledged that electricity prices must “skyrocket" in order to
implement his climate policies. I believe the President. I disagree with his policies.

Page 176

The defense of this proposal will be that the States have “flexibility,” but providing the
States with a narrow range of costly policy choices, which most of the States did not choose for
themselves, does not provide any actual flexibility and still produces the same outcome—higher
electricity prices and decreased generation. Repeating over and over the word “flexibility” is not
an adequate defense or adequate answer to the low-income consumers in my state, or any other
state, who will ask why they must pay more to reduce C02 emissions when those reductions
cannot and will not impact the global climate. '

In reaching this conclusion, I have given the President‘s proposal the benefit of its own
analysis. The US Chamber of Commerce, however, may be closer to the mark when it
predicted that the compliance costs for these regulations will be nearly $480 billion by 2030. or
$28 billion a year by 2030. That is three times the EPA estimates. Electricity is a force
multiplier, rising electric costs damage Gross Domestic Product. The Chamber says the loss will
be $50 billion a year, peaking at over $100 billion in 2025. This would mean a typical family in
my State would lose approximately $3,400 in disposable income, which would affect poor
families disproportionately. I am unwilling to transfer to a federal environmental agency the
indirect, but undeniable, power to reshape my State‘s energy portfolio and choices at the expense
of the hardworking families of Alabama.

Congress did not intend for Clean Air Act section l11(d) to have such far-reaching
consequences for the American people. Indeed, to prevent impacts such as those that will flow
from EPA’s proposed emission guidelines, Congress took care to limit EPA’s authority under
section it 1(d). Given the enormous burdens that would be imposed by EPA’s proposed
guidelines, however, it may be obvious that EPA has simply disregarded the limits of the law.
These limits, moreover, are not questionable or controversial; they are express and clear
elements of the Clean Air Act. As I will explain, the Clean Air Act forbids regulating sources
under section 11 1(d) if they are regulated under section 112 of the Act. Existing electric utility
generating units are regulated under section 1 12. The Clean Air Act also forbids section 11 1(d)
regulations that are based on emission reductions that cannot be achieved at individual facilities
but that instead rely on reductions that require actions by an entire system, including facilities
acting in tandem, state governments, and even electricity consumers. EPA’s proposed emission
guidelines fully embrace a system-wide approach to regulation. EPA has also improperly
attempted to limit section 111(d)’s express statutory delegation of authority to the States, and, in
doing so, EPA’s proposal not only rejects state discretion under the Clean Air Act but jettisons
decades: of unquestioned precedent establishing state jurisdiction over electricity markets. For
each of these reasons. EPA’s proposed emission guidelines must be stopped before they do
lasting damage to the Clean Air Act, the States, and the Nation.

The Clean Air Act Prohibits Regulation of Electric Generating Units Under Section 111(d)

As a threshold matter, the Clean Air Act is abundantly clear that EPA has no authority to
issue this proposal. As explained in a June 6, 2014 letter from West Virginia Attorney General

Page 177

Patrick Morrisey to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy,[1] section 11 1(d) expressly states that
EPA is prohibited from regulating any air pollutant emitted from an existing source category that
is regulated under section 1 12 of the Clean Air Act.[2] EPA has imposed extensive regulations on
existing coal- and natural gas-fired power plants pursuant to section 112, thereby precluding
regulation of these sources under section 111(d). EPA itself has conceded that “a literal reading"
of section 1 11(d) prohibits its proposed 1 11(d) guidelines for existing electric generating units,
but claims an ill-defined right to fundamentally reinterpret the statute.[3] As a state Attorney
General, I believe the law is what the law says, and I am troubled by EPA‘s belief that it can “fill
in the blanks” in a statute when there are no blanks to fill.

The Clean Air Act Does Not Allow 111(d) Standards That Apply “Beyond the Fence—line”

Even if EPA had the authority to issue this proposal, EPA’s proposed emission guidelines
flout fundamental statutory requirements in section 1 1 1(d). At the most basic level, the Clean
Air Act demands that any standards of performance issued by States pursuant to section
111(d)—and any emission guidelines that EPA issues to inform the development of state
standards—represent emission limits reflecting “best system of emission reduction” (“BSER”)
that has been adequately demonstrated for the existing source.[4]

Specifically. section 1 1 1(d) plainly states that the EPA Administrator is to establish a
procedure, including emission guidelines. under which each State prepares and submits “a plan
which establishes standards of performance fi)r any existing source for any air pollutant.”[5]
Further, the Act defines “stationary source" as “any building, structure, facility, or installation
which emits or may emit any air pollutant.”[6] The clear import of these provisions is that 111(d)
standards must be based on the emission reductions that individual sources can achieve by
controlling their own emissions.

The US. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has confirmed that 111(d)
standards must be emission control obligations that can be applied to “a single building,
structure, facility, or installation—the unit prescribed in the statute” and that EPA cannot re-
write the Clean Air At to apply a 11 1(d) standard to “a combination of such units.”[7]

Accordingly, a l 1 l (d) standard of performance can only be based on emissions
reductions that are demonstrated and achievable at individual emitting facilities—here, CO;
reductions that can be achieved at existing coal- and natural gas-fired electric generating units.
In other words, a standard of performance must be based on emission reductions “inside the

fence-line” of a facility. EPA’s proposed 1 1 l(d) guidelines are based on reductions achievable
“beyond the fence—line" and are, therefore, inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

EPA has proposed to conclude that four “building blocks” of measures are the “best
system of emission reduction” for controlling C02 at existing electric generating units. Those
four categories, which EPA calls “building blocks.” are:

(l) Efficiency requirements at coal and natural gas fired electric
generating units;

(2) Substituting generation from the most carbon intensive electric
generating units with generation from less carbon intensive units;

(3) Substituting generating from coal and natural gas-fired electric
generating units with generation from zero-carbon renewable
generation; and

(4) Using demand-side efficiency measures to reduce the total
amount of generation that its needed by consumers.

Building blocks 2, 3, and 4 all depend on C02 emission reductions that can only be
achieved when multiple facilities are operated as a coordinated system. C03 emission reductions
would be achieved under these building blocks, for instance, though emission averaging,
allowance trading, demand-side reductions, and re-dispatching generation from one facility to
another. This approach would effectively regulate the entire category of existing electric
generating units as a single source and base the “standards of performance" on the emission
reductions that arguably might be achievable by the category as a whole, rather than basing
standards on reductions demonstrated and achievable at individual sources. This “beyond the
fence-line” approach to setting 1 11(d) standards is inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and is in
direct violation ofD.C. Circuit's holding in ASARCO v. EPA.

Further, even building block 1—imposing efficiency improvement requirements at coal—
and natural gas- tired electric generating units—violates Clean Air Act requirements. The Clean
Air Act requires that “standards of performance" be “achievable” on a continuous basis by the
facilities regulated under section 111(d), Standards of performance for existing electric
generators based on one—size-fits-all efficiency improvements cannot be “achievable.” The
results possible at individual sources differ wildly: some units may be able to achieve
meaningful efficiency gains; others that are already highly efficient will not be able to further
enhance their efficiency. Evert at individual sources. measures to improve efficiency often
degrade over time, so that the source may not be able to demonstrate the same emission levels
continuously. Moreover, the emission impacts of efficiency improvements are exceedingly
difficult to measure, and if a source is used to its full capacity, there will by definition be no
absolute reduction in emissions. Thus, it is not feasible or consistent with the Clean Air Act to
prescribe or enforce a “standard of performance” based on efficiency improvements for existing
electric generating units.

Page 179

Additionally, undertaking efficiency improvements at a power plant could potentially
incite other regulatory requirements. In the past, EPA and environmental groups have filed
lawsuits alleging that power plant efficiency improvements triggered additional obligations
under the Act’s onerous “New Source Review" program. The potential for additional liability
will have a chilling effect, reducing the availability of compliance options.[8]

EPA’s building block approach to establishing 111(d) guidelines is not only unlawful, it
is inscrutable and onerous. EPA has an obligation to promulgate its guidelines through an open
and transparent process. Unfortunately, EPA has failed to meet that obligation, as this
complicated building block analysis results in complex calculations based on unfounded
technical assumptions that are not adequately explained anywhere in the record. Although my
staff and I are still in the process of unpacking this byzantine analysis, even a cursory review of
the measures required to meet my state’s emissions target is shocking. According to EPA’s
model, by 2030 Alabama would need to eliminate over 20% of its affordable and reliable coal-
fired generation; increase generation from more intermittent renewable energy sources over five—
fold; and expand nuclear generation by over 2.3 million megawatt-hours. These draconian
requirements, built on such a flimsy legal foundation, are a grave abuse of regulatory authority.

The Proposed 111(d) Guidelines Unlawfully Disregard State Authority

The proposed 111(d) guidelines’ substantive shortcomings are compounded by
significant procedural failures that undermine the role of the States under the Clean Air Act.
However, as noted in an analysis sent to EPA from a bipartisan group of 17 Attorneys General,
including myself, the proposal would, in fact, upend the Act’s deliberate division of regulatory
authority between the States and the Federal Government.[9]

At its heart, the Act relies on the principle of “cooperative federalism” and establishes
clearly defined roles for both EPA and the States that recognize that “air pollution control at its
source is the primary responsibility of States and local governments.”lo Cooperative federalism
embodies the values enshrined in the Tenth Amendment to the US. Constitution, which declares
that those powers “not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to
the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” It also reflects the inherent
wisdom of entrusting authority to the level of government that is closest to regulated sources, is
most familiar with local operating conditions, and is most sensitive to local costs and impacts to
consumers and businesses. Yet EPA‘s proposed emission guidelines depart radically from this
fundamental principle and, if finalized, would expand EPA’s authority far beyond the bounds of
the Clean Air Act.

Section 111(d) unambiguously grants States the sole authority to decide what standards
will apply to existing sources and only provides a limited role for EPA — a role the Agency has

of the Clean Air Act, Sep. 11, 20l3.

10 Clean Air Act § 101(a)(3).

Page 180

plainly overstepped here. The Act merely authorizes EPA to “establish a procedure” for States
to submit plans establishing standards of performance for existing sources.[11] Clearly, EPA’s role
in regulating existing sources is purely procedural: the Agency has no authority to establish the
substantive requirements to be imposed. It is States that establish the applicable emission
standards. EPA’s implementing regulations allow the Agency to promulgate an “emission
guideline" setting forth “criteria for judging the adequacy” of state plans, but these guidelines do
not impose any substantive obligations on States or existing sources.[12]

Section 111(d) requires that the procedure for submitting these state plans must be similar
to section 110’s procedure for submitting state implementation plans, or “SIPs.” implementing
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. It is important that Congress used this analogy,
because it highlights the substantial discretion States can exercise in designing their plans for
existing sources and EPA’s limited ability to second-guess that discretion. Nearly 40 years ago,
the US. Supreme Court held in Union Electric Co. v. EPA that the Agency must approve a, SIP if
the State has accounted for all of the relevant statutory requirements. even if EPA disagrees with
the State’s choice of emission limits.[13] More recently. the fifth Circuit repeated that “the Act
confines the EPA to the ministerial function of reviewing SIP’s for consistency with the Act’s
requirements.”[14]

In that vein, section 111(d) limits EPA to the “ministerial function” of approving state
plans for existing sources as long as the State has considered the appropriate statutory
requirements—4n this case, the factors listed in section 111(a)(1)to set its “standards of
performance.” That provision states that standards of performance must be “achievable” for
individual sources through the application of the “best system of emission reduction” that has
been adequately demonstrated, and must account for costs, energy requirements. and other
environmental impacts.[15] Under 111(d). it is the States— not EPA — that are authorized to
establish emission standards; therefore it is the States — and not EPA—that weigh these statutory
factors to determine what standard is appropriate for existing sources. As with the SIPs, EPA
cannot use its emission guidelines to dictate the substance of the standards in state plans; it can
only require that States adopt performance standards that are based on the application of the
statutory factors.

EPA's proposed emission guidelines for greenhouse gases bear no resemblance to the
CAA‘s legal framework or to any of EPA’s previous 111(d) rulemakings. Instead of recognizing
State authority and expertise, EPA has relegated States to implementing a federal mandate
handed down from Washington, regardless of its costs, effectiveness, or achievability in light of
local circumstances. Despite the Agency‘s numerous public claims to have incorporated
“flexibility" into its unprecedented approach, EPA’s proposal actually denies States the
flexibility that section 111(d) mandates and that the States have historically exercised.

Page 181

For example, the Clean Air Act explicitly allows States to consider “the remaining useful
life” and “other factors” within the State’s discretion in order to tailor standards to individual
sources.[16] Likewise, States are free to determine that a specific source or group of sources
should be subject to a less stringent standard or longer compliance schedule because of costs,
physical limitations on installing control equipment, or any other factor making a less stringent
standard more reasonable.[17]

But under the proposed emission guidelines, EPA is attempting to strip that discretion
from the States. The Agency makes clear that under its approach. any State plan that does not
match the target emission rate chosen by EPA will be rejected. And because the target rates rely
on the exercise of all the State’s tools, no discretion remains. Putting aside the lack of any
language in the Clean Air Act authorizing EPA to establish mandatory emission guidelines, by
proposing a single state-wide emission rate for existing sources. the Agency is eliminating
States” inherent ability to adjust their plans to account for costs, achievability, aging sources, or
any of the other myriad factors a state may rely on to perform its statutory role of establishing
emission standards. Each State’s proposed target subsumes all existing sources under one
emission rate, preventing any meaningful sub-categorization or individualization of standards: a
State cannot reduce the burden on one source (as section 111(d) allows it to do) without
increasing the burden on others. Given that EPA’s proposed targets appear to be unachieveably
high at the outset, depriving States of their ability to account for local impacts will only
exacerbate the destructive consequences of EPA’s guidelines for consumers and for the
economy. EPA should abandon its attempt to usurp the role of the States.

The Proposed 111(d) Guidelines Would Displace Traditional State Control of Electricity
Markets

The proposed 111(d) guidelines also undermine State roles in policy areas well outside
the Clean Air Act. For nearly a century. States have enjoyed substantial flexibility to oversee the
generation and distribution of electricity within their borders. This autonomy flows from the
Federal Power Act’s recognition that State and federal authorities occupy distinct and separate
spheres with regard to the regulation of electricity. Specifically. the Federal Power Act broadly
limits federal regulations “only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the
States." Thus, the Federal Government may exercise jurisdiction over the transmission of
electricity in interstate commerce. as well as wholesale sales of electricity in interstate
commerce.[18] As recently as last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit reaffirmed that, absent a “clear and specific grant of jurisdiction.” the Federal
Government cannot regulate areas of the electricity market left by the Federal Power Act to the
States.

18 l6 U.S.C. § 824(a) and (b). Consistent with the scope of this express statutory authorization, it has been
recognized that the Federal Power Act permits regulation of unbundled sales of transmission in a state, even when
such sales are at retail. See New York v. FERC. 535 U.S. l (2002).

19 Electric Power Supply Association v. FERC. No, 1 l-l486 at 9 (DC. Cir, May 23, 2014).

Page 182

EPA claims its outside the fence—line approach offers States flexible options to implement
the proposed 111(d) guidelines. What EPA calls “flexibilities”—changing dispatch rules,
mandating efficiency, utilizing other generation sources—are, in fact, the very intrastate
generation, transmission, and distribution matters explicitly reserved by the Federal Power Act
for the States. By requiring States to meet standards based on these outside the fence-line
actions. the l 1 1(d) guidelines effectively upend the Federal Power Act‘s careful balance between
State and federal authority, subverting traditional State control of retail electricity matters with a
federal mandate to overhaul virtually every aspect of the intrastate electricity system. Thus, the
proposed 1 11(d) guidelines effectively replace the Federal Power Act’s co-regulatory model with
federal regulations, in EPA’s own words, “from plant to plug”20—»granting the Federal
Government powers denied it for nearly the entire history of the electricity grid. Since 1915, the
Alabama Public Service Commission has guided intrastate electricity development so as to
protect rate-payers and ensure reliability. Under EPA‘s proposed 111(d) guidelines, however,
the Commission could continue these efforts only in so much as they comport with EPA’s
greenhouse gas agenda.

Congress surely did not intend to undermine the entire Federal Power Act structure by
authorizing such expansive powers under the Clean Air Act—particularly under section 111(d),
where, as explained above, State and federal powers are so carefully tailored. Rather, this
provision can only be coherently read. both internally and externally, as contemplating measures
solely inside the fence-line of a designated facility. Indeed. while the proposed 1 l 1(d) guidelines
quote analysis questioning whether the division between inside and outside the fence-line
measures “arguably becomes irrelevant, at least from a legal perspective[,]”2' the Federal Power
Act’s express limitations make clear that this distinction is not without cause. By limiting ll 1(d)
to only those measures inside the fence-line of a designated facility. Congress constrained EPA
to the role of environmental protection and prevented the Agency from impinging on outside
policy matters like traditional electricity regulation. Ultimately, limits on federal power in both
the Federal Power Act and Clean Air Act section 111(d) are not legally irrelevant, but instead
reflect Congressional assent to the Tenth Amendment’s exhortation that "the powers not
delegated to the United States by the Constitution. nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved
to the States respectively. or to the people.”

Conclusion

The State ofAlabama vigorously opposes EPA’s proposed mandate to effectively
restructure the electric sector, as it would have disastrous consequences for electric reliability
and the economy. Those consequences. moreover, would all stem from a patently unlawful
application of the Clean Air Act. EPA’s proposal seeks to expand the scope of section 111(d) in
an unprecedented manner. It would do so at the expense of State authority that is expressly
identified and preserved in the Clean Air Act and in the unquestionable jurisdiction of States
over intrastate electricity markets. And it would do all of these things for no discernible benefit.
given the increasing emissions of China and other developing economies. There is no rationale
that can support such a regulation, and this Committee should ensure that it is halted.

Answers to Follow-up Questions for Alabama Attornev General Luther Strange

Question from Senator David Vitter

l. Attorney General Strange. last year, the Senate EPW Republicans released a report
entitled, “Neglecting a Cornerstone Principle of the Clean Air Act: President Obama's
EPA Leaves States Behind.” The report chronicles EPA’s increasing departure from the
cooperative federalism approach established in the Clean Air Act. When it comes to
EPA‘s implementation of the President’s Climate Action Plan, is it your opinion that
EPA is abiding by the cooperative federalism design of the Clean Air Act? ls EPA
seeking to cooperate with the States?

Answer: No, EPA is absolutely failing to abide by the Clean Air Act’s cooperative
federalism design. instead of seeking to cooperate or collaborate with the States as
Congress intended, EPA is attempting to unilaterally carry out a mandate from the
Executive Branch.

In enacting the Clean Air Act, Congress relied on the principle of cooperative federalism,
establishing clearly defined roles for both EPA and the States and recognizing that air
pollution control is the primary responsibility of States and local governments. As I
explained in my written testimony, EPA’s proposed implementation of the President’s
Climate Action Plan represents a radical departure from that fundamental principle, and if
finalized. would expand EPA‘s authority far beyond the bounds of the Clean Air Act.
EPA has clearly overstepped its limited role in Clean Air Act implementation. EPA is
authorized only to “establish a procedure" for States to submit plans establishing
standards of performance for existing sources: the Agency has no authority to establish
the substantive requirements to be imposed. It is States that establish the applicable
emission standards. But under EPA’s proposal. EPA attempts to divest that discretion
from the States.

EPA’s failure to abide by the Clean Air Act and recognize State authority and expertise
in implementing the President’s Climate Action Plan is the latest instance of EPA’S
repeated attempts to usurp States’ powers under the Act in the last several years. Often
springing from secretive “sue and settle" arrangements with environmental organizations
that exclude the States, EPA has again and again stripped States of their statutory powers
by revoking longstanding, well-accepted provisions of state implementation
plans (“SIP”) and imposing excessively stringent. costly, and even unachievable
standards.

Questions front Senator Jeff Sessions

1. Your testimony points out that EPAs Mercury and Air Toxics Standards will close
ten times more power plants than the Agency had projected — numbers supported by
analysis from DOE’s Energy Information Administration. Even the LA. Times said
EPA’s projections for that rule “turned out wrong almost immediately." In light of this
inaccurate history, can States credibly rely on EPA’s impact analysis for the proposed
existing power plant guidelines?

Answer: No, given EPA’s track record, States cannot reasonably rely on the agency’s
impact analysis for its proposal. EPA‘s wildly inaccurate estimates of the MATS Rule’s
effects are indicative of the great lengths the agency will go to in an attempt to conceal
the devastating impact its climate proposal will have on the economy, industry. and
electric reliability. Note that, as outlined in my written testimony, even EPA‘s own
(likely underestimated) predictions are alarming, but the (likely accurate) estimates of the
US Chamber of Commerce are downright terrifying and demand withdrawal of EPA’s
proposal. By the Chamber’s calculations, compliance costs by 2030 will be three times
greater than EPA has estimated.

2. Are you concerned that the proposed existing power plant guidelines could undermine
the ability of state utility commissions to protect rate-payers and ensure reliability? If so,
why?

Answer: Yes. Under the Federal Power Act, the States have considerable autonomy in
overseeing the generation and distribution of electricity within their borders. The Federal
Government may regulate only those aspects of the electricity market not designated for
regulation by the States under the Federal Power Act. But EPA’s proposal involves
requiring States to meet standards based on changes in the very intrastate generation,
transmission, and distribution matters that the Federal Power Act reserves for the States.
EPA’s effective seizure of States’ control over their own electricity systems would leave
utility commissions like the Alabama Public Service Commission without the ability to
guide intrastate electricity development unless their choices conform to EPA‘S
preferences with respect to the climate plan. This would impair States” ability to protect
rate-payers and ensure reliability, which could have disastrous economic consequences
for the States.

3. At the hearing, you were asked by Senator Boxer whether “Alabama lost all recent
major Clean Air Act cases" including legal challenges to the Cross-State Air Pollution
Rule, the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule (Utility MACT), and the endangerment finding
and light duty vehicle GI-lG tailpipe standards, I understand that Sen. Boxer’s question
may have over—simplified the legal posture and outcomes of those cases. Please
supplement your response so that the record is more complete on this topic.

Answer: Yes, I would like to clarify my response to Senator Boxer‘s question with
respect to the legal challenge to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (the Transport
Rule”). Although the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision indeed reversed and remanded the
decision of the D.C. Circuit to vacate the Transport Rule, there are multiple unresolved

Page 185

issues that the D.C. Circuit may consider on remand. While disagreeing that EPA’s
approach to defining what constitutes a “significant contribution to non attainment” was
facially invalid. the Supreme Court agreed with the D.C. Circuit that the Clean Air Act
precludes EPA from requiring reductions in upwind state emissions that are “more than
the amount necessary” to eliminate significant contributions to non attainment.
Furthermore, the Supreme Court’s decision recognized that States may bring
particularized challenges to the Transport Rule. Now that the case is once again before
the D.C. Circuit, Alabama and other States have requested the opportunity to address
those unresolved issues in supplemental briefing. Thus the case remains pending, and the
outcome is yet unknown.

1 would also like to clarify my response to Senator Boxer’s question with respect to the
legal challenge to the MATS Rule. Alabama and other parties have submitted a petition
for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the D.C. Circuit’s
decision upholding the rule. Thus, that case remains pending, as well

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Now, finally, we have Dr. Mason. Please 
proceed, sir. 
STATEMENT OF JOSEPH R. MASON, HERMANN MOYSE, JR./ 
LOUISIANA BANKERS ASSOCIATION ENDOWED PROFESSOR 
OF BANKING, LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY AND SENIOR 
FELLOW, THE WHARTON SCHOOL 

Mr. MASON. Good morning and thank you for inviting me to tes-
tify here today on this crucially important topic. 
My research specialty throughout my career has been market 
failures and crises. I began studying cap and trade markets in 2005 
as the EU system became a reality and quickly began to fail. 
I did so because of the preternatural push among lawmakers to 
embark upon cap and trade solutions despite widespread consensus 
among economists that cap and trade does not suit carbon emis-
sions. 

With respect to Chairman Boxer’s earlier medical analogy, I do 
not disagree with the diagnosis here but with the proposed treat-
ment. You are all presupposing that the treatment is known. It is 
not. 

In recent history, no system, not the EU, the RGGI or the Cali-
fornia Initiative has priced carbon at levels prohibitive to emis-
sions. Prices currently hover at just $5 on the RGGI, $11 in Cali-
fornia and between those two levels in the EU. It is widely viewed 
that prices in excess of $30 are necessary to cut emissions. 
The recent EPA proposal seems to be merely an attempt to speci-
fy quantity goals instead of price goals. There are two problems 
with this approach. 

First, to control quantity, one has to actually be in control of the 
thing one targets. The U.S. Federal Reserve wanted this years ago 
when it had to move away from targeting the money supply be-
cause so many near money substitutes existed that it really had no 
effectiveness just monitoring cash and checking account balances. 
In carbon markets, the common policy of carbon permit 
fungibility has always rendered this quantity targeting unwork-
able. In a series of famous cases, the EU high court ruled that EU 
member states have sovereignty over the amount of permits they 
issue. 

In one famous case in 2010 when invalid permits infiltrated 
BlueNext, the exchange had to close for 3 days while the permits 
could be isolated and swapbacks could be arranged for them to be 
removed from the market. 

Second, as an economist, it does not matter which side of the 
price quantity coin you look at, the effects are the same. Quantity 
will go down only if price goes up. When real prices go up, output 
declines and unemployment increases. 

Corporations already forego billions of dollars of investment due 
to anticipated carbon prices and States in which those corporations 
operate will feel the effects of this new policy. It is important to 
remember, however, those are not just oil and gas companies but 
companies like Walt Disney and Wal-Mart. 
In preparing for this hearing, I regressed the State EPA goals 
normalized for each State’s percent of power from coal in 2013 on 
a number of very important variables. Perhaps most importantly,

the regression shows that States with lagging economies coming 
out of the great recession have tougher goals to meet than others. 
Certainly there are simple adjustments that can be made to miti-
gate the effects of carbon policy upon economic growth if we just 
think about those for a moment. 

No government has yet accepted the lower economic growth nec-
essary to meaningfully curb carbon emissions. Officials know prices 
should go up but cannot bear the political heat of restricting per-
mits to achieve that goal. 

In fact, in March 2014, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, 
George Osborne, announced the government would freeze attacks 
on carbon emissions as part of a broad plan to cut consumer energy 
bills. While his party backs carbon reform, consumer energy costs 
have become a campaign plank for the opposition which vowed to 
freeze energy prices if they win in mid–2015. 

A similar issue is growing in Germany which is subsidized re-
newables growth with a mandatory household surcharge on elec-
tricity and voters are not happy. 

By far, the worst effects of carbon markets have been the regu-
latory arbitrage fraud and theft that have occurred on such sys-
tems. If we are not ready to deal with the existing corporate fraud 
and bribery, tax fraud, investor fraud, counterfeiting, money laun-
dering, hacking and phishing on carbon markets that have troubled 
established markets in recent years, we should not be discussing 
their implementation in the largest economy in the world. 
Denying the failure of existing carbon policy risks raising energy 
prices without reducing carbon output. U.N. climate talks on car-
bon broke down this week over this simple economic fact. 
Extending my analogy with central banking, Members of Con-
gress should remember that the National Monetary Commission 
studied central bank functions around the world for 7 years before 
concluding upon the design of the U.S. Federal Reserve system. 
Let us take our time now and research existing carbon abate-
ment mechanisms before emulating demonstratively failed schemes 
around the world, enriching financial industry interest groups at 
the cost of our economy while continuing to allow carbon to grow 
as a national and global problem. 

Thank you.

The US government is once again pursuing cap and trade mechanisms. As an economist, I have
to say I have no idea why.

Since I am not a climate scientist I cannot opine from more than a lay perspective on whether
there is a consensus in the discipline on man-made global warming. Since I am an economist,
however, 1 can say that there exists a wholesale consensus among economists that carbon is not
well-suited for cap and trade.

Moreover, existing markets in the US and EU have failed to price carbon at levels that lead to
reduced carbon emissions because to do so would be costly to economic growth. The question of
“who can issue the permits” continues to drag down the effectiveness of the EU system, and
poses considerable problems for the proposed state~level system in the US. There is no plan for
investing the proceeds from permit sales in developing clean technology. And existing carbon
markets have been prone to fraud, theft, and counterfeiting worldwide. All of this is widely
reported and known throughout the world. Jumping in with our eyes closed to such crucial
developments exposes US citizens and the US, and world, economies to unnecessary risk.

Below, I review recent evidence on the shortcomings of cap and trade, concluding that we should
emulate the historical approach we took to establishing a central bank after the Panic of 1907:
take our time and study what works and what does not so that we design an effective system that
does not pose unnecessary costs upon our nation.

I. The Price of Carbon on Cap and Trade Markets Has Not Achieved Levels to
Restrain Output

Cap and trade does not work for carbon. The reasons for that failure are multi-faceted, but the
simple fact is that even existing markets have not priced carbon at levels that restrain output for
many years now.

The ETS has suffered from a drastic oversupply of carbon permits for quite some time. In
October 2009, Peter Zapfel, assistant to the deputy director general of the environment
department at the European Commission, said the oversupply of government allowances is
threatening to overwhelm the system. At the time, many newer EU members from Central and
Eastern Europe contributed a huge oversupply of credits. These counties have excess credits that
numbered roughly five times the number in European market, depressing prices and undermining
carbon reduction goals the market was formed to support.[1]

Since then, little has changed. In fact, by January 2013, record low auction bids from utilities,
factories and banks led Germany to cancel an auction of European Union emission permits for
the first time, ever. Connie Hedegaard, the EU’s climate chief, said the cancellation should be a
“wake—up call” for those who do not support the plan to strengthen the emissions trading

system.[2] At the close of trading on Friday, June 13, 2014, EU carbon was trading at 5.71 euro.
far short of the 20—euro level needed to prompt industry and utilities to invest in greener energy.[3]

The US is following a similar path by emulating the EU system instead of learning from its
problems. Currently there are two markets in US: one in California (California Air Resources
Board) and the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGl) in Northeast. Neither
prices carbon at levels that restrict carbon emissions.

Most recently, it was reported that California companies bought all 16.95 million allowances to
release carbon emissions at the state’s May 16, 2014 cap—and-trade auction. The price for the
carbon allowances was $11.50 each, slightly higher than the previous two auctions in February
and November, each of which sold allowances for $11.48 each. An additional 4 million permits
that can’t be used until 2017, of the 9.2 million that were available, sold at $11.36.

Analysts at Thompson Reuters Point Carbon expect prices to hover just above the program’s
auction floor price of $11.34 a metric ton through 2014. Earlier this year, analysts predicted
California carbon prices would remain low through 2020 due to excess permits.[4]

“The price for power plants to emit one ton of carbon dioxide in nine northeastern U.S. states
cleared at a record high $5.02 per short ton at the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative’s (RGGI)
23rd permit auction,” the market's administrator said on Friday, June 6, 2014.[5]

The sad fact for politicians is that markets are doing exactly what we economists expect them to
do. There is virtually no disagreement among economists that the true cost to society of burning
a ton of carbon is greater than its private cost. However, “agreeing that the [social cost of carbon]
is greater than zero isn’t really agreeing on very much.”[6] The market, in fact, is pricing the most
likely environmental scenarios, for which temperature increases are moderate and effects are
small, putting carbon in roughly the $10 to $40 range.

But that is precisely what markets do. Markets price the “expected" value. If we want to prices to
reflect more dramatic outcomes we will have to use a carbon tax. In short, just like in the recent
financial crisis, markets are doing what they are supposed to do. Back then, politicians did not
like the fact that markets were telling us that a meltdown was coming. Here, politicians do not
like the fact that markets pricing the most likely (but not most destructive) scenarios, and they

will not do anything else. Either way, markets are telling us the unvarnished truth, whether we
like it or not.

II. Announcing a Quantity Target is No Different

One of the hallmarks of the EPA’s recent proposal is to establish carbon intensity goals, in effect
setting quantity targets rather than price targets that have been the focus of prior carbon
abatement mechanisms.

To a monetary economist, however, a quantity target is just the flip side of a price target.
Through the history of modern central banking, the US Federal Reserve has experimented with
both. For certain periods of time, the Federal Reserve used quantity targets (i.e., M l) and for
others, price targets (i.e., the Fed Funds rate). There is no clear evidence that one is superior to
the other. In fact, in some periods of history quantities worked fine, while in other prices were
superior. Thus, it will be an economic question whether price or quantity is a better target.

It is unclear whether the quantities set are correct, meaningful, or achievable, If they are
incorrect, they will be so because they either have no effect on carbon output or they are
economically unachievable. If they are unachievable, they will be challenged by the relevant
states and, most likely, altered.

The possibility of alteration by Congressional or administrative fiat, however, is precisely the
political risk that has contributed price volatility to the EU system. Critics complain that carbon
price volatility and the market’s exposure to political risk mean the system does not encourage
companies to invest in emission reduction, because the goals may be ultimately changed (or
firms can lobby for change).[7]

III. Any effective program WILL restrain economic growth
But to begin with, we will first have to set some truly restrictive targets. It is doubtful, however,
that meaningfully restrictive targets will arise from Congressional or administrative fiat because
elected officials do not like to restrain growth, such decisions will force them to pick winners
and losers, and states, industries, and even groups of consumers will have to be chosen.

A. The effects of carbon goals will be uneven

Widespread press coverage already noted the disparity of the goals across states. The financial
Times’ Ed Crooks immediately noted that the states with the most demanding targets included

7 financial Times (USA); Date: Dec 7, 2009; Section: Investing in commodities; Page: SR7-6.

Page 193

Arizona, South Carolina, Oregon, and New Hampshire, while states with least demanding targets
included Maine, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and Iowa.[8]

Moreover, Crooks noted that there was perhaps a tenuous connection between goals and actual
carbon dioxide states will emit.[9] Bloomberg Energy finance reported that California, Nebraska,
Rhode Island can actually increase volume of emissions in absolute terms. Louisiana, Arkansas,
Idaho will face the largest cuts. [10]

In its ground—breaking “Clean Power Plan ” released 2 June, the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to work with 49 states to slash the C02 intensity of
fossil-fuel power generation by 2030. The headlines were simple enough: US plans to cut
its emissions 30% from 2005 levels. But what the regulation actually does is lay out a
series of convoluted state-level targets designed to reduce the carbon intensity of
states’ power.[11]

Heightening the probability of political risk and disruptive volatility, “President Barack Obama’s
plan to cut power plants’ carbon dioxide emissions places a widely differing burden on different
states, opening the proposals to objections from those that feel they are being treated unfairly."
Jacob Hollinger, a former EPA lawyer who is now a partner at McDermott, Will & Emery, was
quoted as saying he was “’surprised’ by the differences in the demands made of different states.
‘The implications aren’t totally developed yet, and that is something people should be
scrutinizing very carefully,m he said. [12]

My own analysis suggests that the differences in goals among states are also related to politics.
In preparing for this hearing, I regressed the goals multiplied by each states’ percent of power
from coal in 2013[13] (to adjust the goals for existing carbon intensity) on each states’ GSP and
employment change from 2007 to the most recent quarter, as well as variables related to the
Democrat’s “political productivity" of each state in the 2012 elections. [14]

[13] The range of the dependent variable is -0.96 to +0.35, since some states are allowed to increase, overall.

[14] The theory of political productivity starts with the notion that a state that cannot be won regardless of
what favoritism is directed their way is not worth pursuing, as is one that the party knows they will win
regardless of what favoritism is directed their way. Thus, swing states are the ones that parties favor,
because grants or programs benefitting those states can have the most “productivity" in elections. The
method has been applied to examining the distribution of Federal grants and expenditures from the Great
Depression to today.

Page 194

The regression shows that the EPA’s goals are inversely related to GSP growth between 2007
and the most recent quarter (in other words, states with higher change in GSP from 2007 to the
most recent quarter less restrictive goals, punishing states with lagging economies coming out of
the recession) and the effect is statistically significant. The EPA’s (normalized) goals are
positively related to unemployment (states with less of a recovery in unemployment since 2007
have less restrictive goals to meet), though the effect statistically insignificant at conventional
levels. Political productivity for the Democratic Party, however, is positive and statistically
significant suggesting the EPA’s goals would have benefitted the Democrats in the past
presidential election. Assuming 2016 is similar, the distribution of EPA goals among states will
benefit them then, too.

B. The unevenness of the EPA’s goals will affect state-level jobs and growth

It has been clear from applications, worldwide, that companies that do business in regions in
which carbon is priced will build carbon costs into their investment and planning decisions. For
instance, Shell Vice President Angus Gillespie has stated publicly that climate policies can cost
potential investment projects “hundreds of millions of dollars" and that “there are opportunities
we have not progressed because of the $40 a ton" carbon cost estimate that they use internally in
their capital budgeting process. [15]

But it is not just energy companies that price carbon costs into their planned investments. At
least twenty—eight US companies are known to report the carbon prices that they use for internal
capital budgeting, including: Delphi Automotive, Walt Disney, ConAgra Foods, Walmart,
Apache Corporation, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, ExxonMobil, Hess, Shell,
Wells Fargo, Cummins, Delta Air Lines, General Electric, Google, Jabil Circuit, Microsoft, El
du Pont de Nemours, Ameren, American Electrical Power, CMS Energy, Duke Energy, Entergy,
Integrys Energy, PG&E and Xcel Energy. [16]

First, note the diversity of those companies, including energy firms like Exxon, consumer firms
such as Walmart, and even entertainment firms like Disney. Clearly, carbon costs affect a broad
swath of our economy.

But even more interesting is the diversity of carbon prices used by each of those firms. Prices
range from $10—$20 at Disney to $60 at Exxon, and a wide variety of prices in between. As
previously stated, carbon price volatility has been an enduring feature of the EU market and
political risk in the EU and the US continues to contribute to widely disparate views of the price
of carbon in the future, as a result.

Page 195

C. Economic effects will hit consumers, as well

The broad industry exposure to carbon prices illustrated above will undoubtedly affect
consumers, not just in their utility bills but in all manner of expenditures. So far, the impact on
utility bills is expected to be modest, but this expectation seems to be based on natural gas prices
remaining low.

Further investment in renewables and other energy sources will undoubtedly push up consumer
costs.

According to the International Energy Agency, global investment in the energy sector will need
to reach $38tn between 2011 and 2035, based on existing trends. Almost $17tn of this will be for
electrical power, covering generation, transmission and distribution. Citi analysts said in a report
in September that, while renewables are forecast to make up 50 per cent of additional power
output capacity by 2035, they will cost $5.9m, against $3.9m for conventional sources.[17]

One of the most radical transformations in electrical power is happening in Germany, “where the
government has committed to phasing out nuclear power stations and switching to renewable
energies within a decade.” But new installation of subsidized wind and solar is pushing up
electricity prices for consumers. Guaranteed prices for electricity from renewable sources have
encouraged investors to build new capacity. The higher prices, however, have come at the
expense of consumers in the form of increased energy bills, in order to pay green energy
generators an estimated €20.4bn in feed—in tariffs in 2013. [18]

As a result, in October 2013, the country‘s grid operators raised the mandatory surcharge on
units of electricity to a record 5.3 cents per kWh for 2014, up from 3.6 cents. “For a typical
household using 3500 kWh per year, this surcharge would rise from €125 to €185. The move is
all the more contentious as many businesses are exempted, to protect their international
competitiveness.” [19]

IV. ...but if it doesn’t also restrain carbon, it is all pain and no gain...

A. Governments don’t have the appetite for restraining economic growth (that’s why
we have independent central banks)

As a result of such obvious costs, no system has yet to restrain carbon permit issues to levels that
meaningfully restrict carbon output. Even though Germany has come around to imposing costs
of developing renewable energy sources on individual consumers, carbon prices are still too low

17 “Green agenda prompts pricing concerns,” Financial Times Special Report on Energy, November 5,
2012 at 2.

Page 196

to restrict output. Thus, Germany’s is a pure subsidy-driven plan, not a carbon market—driven
plan.

Germany, in fact, cancelled an auction in January 2013 due to record low bids from utilities,
factories and banks forced Germany to cancel a sale for the first time. Connie Hedegaard, the
EU’s climate chief said afterward, “the need to fix the market is getting urgent.” Johannes
Teyssen, chief executive officer of EON SE, Germany’s biggest power utility, said in an
interview with Manager Magazine that the EU greenhouse gas trading system is now, “a joke the
whole world laughs about.” Matthew Gray, an analyst in London at Jefferies Group Inc, opined
that some buyers will probably wait for prices to drop further and the commission has limited
influence to contain the market’s decline. The problem is, when the bloc set the program’s cap
before 2008, it didn’t install a system for dealing with a supply glut.[20]

In December 2013, EU Parliament finally voted to backload (delay) sales of 900 million carbon
permits. Matthias Groote, the German Socialist lawmaker who steered the legislation through
parliament, argued that, “backloading is not enough. The market is still oversupplied by 2 billion
permits, but this buys us time to have a discussion on how to reform it." Still, the proposal
caused “fierce divisions within member states, national governments and the European
Parliament over fears it will push up energy prices and dent economic growth.”[21]

As a result of the decision, the benchmark December 2013 EU Allowance futures ended the
trading day at 4.90 euros. Assuming the first allowances will be withheld from the market in the
second half of 2014, Marcus Ferdinand, an analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, “forecast
the Dec-14 carbon price will increase by 35 percent compared to this years’ (mean) price, to an
average of 6 euros.” Analysts predicted prices could eventually double due to backloading, but
that it would still be years before they rise above the 20-euro level needed to prompt industry and
utilities to invest in greener energy. Some EU lawmakers believe the bloc‘s carbon market will
be irrelevant without further reform. [22]

On the March 19, 2014, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announce the
government would freeze a tax on carbon emissions starting in April 2016 as part of a broad plan
to cut consumer energy bills. Consumer energy costs have become a campaign plank, with Prime
Minister David Cameron’s administration coming under pressure to rein in rising energy costs as
a result of Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, vowing in November to freeze
energy prices if he wins the next election in mid—2015. That move prompted the government in

to announce measures cutting green levies by 50 pounds per household a year in December
2013.[23]

As of Monday, June 16, 2014, “the use of carbon markets to curb rising greenhouse gas
emissions was dealt a blow on Sunday after two weeks of United Nations talks on designing and
reforming the mechanisms ended in deadlock?”[24]

At the close of trading on June 13, 2014, the price was 5.71 euros.

B. Arguments abound over who decides the supply of permits, and this new Federal
layer will intensify those in the US

Part of the problem in Europe has been jurisdiction over the issuance of carbon permits.

In 2007, the EU executive rejected Poland‘s national allocation plan (NAP), which set its total
emission allocations and outlined how it intended to distribute them to individual factories
covered by the scheme. The EU ’5 main objection was that countries like Poland intended to
allocate too many allowances. [25]

In September 2009, the Commission’s decision was overturned by the European Court of first
Instance (the General Court). “The court found that member states alone can take the final
decision on the total number of allowances to allocate, and ruled that the EU executive had
misused its powers.” That decision also ruled on disagreements with Slovakia, the first country
to take the issue to the court, and Estonia. All three countries argued that the EU’s limits were
too low and would hurt their economics. [26]

In 2013, a Superior Court judge in California rejected a private legal challenge to California’s
carbon auctions. In that action, the California Chamber of Commerce and Pacific Legal
Foundation, on behalf of a dozen clients including Morning Star Packing Company and Dalton
Trucking, had filed lawsuits in Sacramento Superior Court to block the carbon allowances.[27]
While I am not qualified to opine on the legal details, it seems to me that this ruling sets the
framework for a similar problem to that of the EU member states where, regardless of the EPA’s
goals, states’ rights to set permit levels may not be able to be challenged.

C. There is no appetite for using proceeds of carbon permit sales to invest in new
technology

Since carbon prices remain depressed. California’s quarterly permit auctions will only raise $21
billion for the period through 2020, well below the anticipated $60 billion in revenue.28

Sales have raised $396 million for the state so far, and that money was initially intended to be
devoted to efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions by subsidizing renewables and new
technologies. Instead, however, Governor Jerry Brown decided to, “lend $500 million from the
funds to the California state legislature to plug gaps in the state‘s budget,” The state is supposed
to repay the state-run greenhouse gas emissions reduction account at a later date.[29]

Perhaps California can come around. The California Legislature announced Monday, June 16,
2014 that it had approved a $108 billion spending plan for the 2014-15 fiscal year that included,
“$250 million for the High-Speed Rail project, along with 25 percent of future cap=and-trade
funds. . .. Lawmakers also agreed to spend $200 million using cap-and-trade revenue on low-
carbon transportation projects and $130 million on affordable housing projects near mass
transit.”[30] Of course, that budget is subject to approval by Governor Jerry Brown. But even if he
approves, the on-again, off-again nature of green commitments in California will make it
difficult for firms to commit to providing jobs and growth in that sector in the long-run.

Even devoting carbon permit revenues to mass transit, new technologies and renewables,
however, has been derided as unjustifiable. “Those most vulnerable to climate change are often
least responsible for its causes, and have the fewest resources to deal with its consequences.”[31]

The revenues could support vulnerable countries’ efforts to develop long term plans to
deal with climate change, as well as finance pilot projects aimed at minimizing loss and
damage... They could fund the monitoring and forecasting of slow-onset and extreme—
weather events, enabling authorities and the public to prepare more effectively for an
impending disaster. And the money could cover loss—and-damage risk premiums on
individual, local, national. regional, or international insurance policies. [32]

climate—related hardships inflicted upon them by past and present industrialization." [33]

V. Worse yet, if carbon markets just benefit Wall Street then they just create new
interest groups to capture the government and the financial markets

The Interpol Environmental Crime Programme now lists ten classifications of carbon crimes that
have already occurred throughout the world and continue to remain a threat.[34] Those include:
* Manipulating measurements to fraudulently claim additional carbon credits
(Additionality);
Sale of carbon credits that either do not exist or belong to someone else;
* False or misleading claims with respect to the environmental or financial benefits of
carbon market investments;
* Exploitation of weak regulations to commit financial crimes;
* Tax Fraud;
* Securities Fraud;
* Transfer mispricing;
* Money laundering;
* Internet crimes and computer hacking to steal carbon credits; and
* Phishing/Theft of personal information or identity theft.

Some environmentalists even get it. Friends of the Earth has recognized such crimes and, as a
result, advocates a carbon tax rather than cap and trade.35

Still, politicians remain preternaturally attracted to cap and trade, even as carbon markets
continue to grow and problems continue to mount.

A. Investor Fraud

As carbon markets grow, the carbon fund market has grown. as well. Carbon funds — like mutual
funds with stocks or bonds — accept (private or public) investor money to purchase carbon
permits. According to the latest survey by Carbon finance, a carbon market data service
published by Environmental Finance, over 2008-09, funds under management grew by 20 per
cent to $16.1bn (£9.8bn, €10.7bn). The number of carbon funds and government purchase
programs increased from 80 to 88. 36

36 “Carbon funds grow despite problems." financial Times, Dec 7, 2009; Page: SR7—6.

Page 200

Mark Nicholls, editor of Environmental Finance, who published the survey noted that, “thirty—
eight of the 88 funds listed are governmental carbon purchasing vehicles, or are run by multi~
laterals either for governments or emitting companies, or a combination. The majority of the
remainder are open to institutional investors.” “Of the 12 funds that were launched since the
2008-09 edition, only two were governmental or multilateral; the rest were private sector
vehicles.”[37]

The returns can be lucrative. “The European Carbon Fund, run by French bank Natixis and one
of the earliest run to generate a cash return, says that based on its net asset value at the end of
2008, the fund has generated an annual return of 27.8 per cent since its inception in April
2005”[38]

The problem is that such returns quickly attract fraudulent schemes.

Interpol reported that in 2009 and 2010, an Australian investment firm ran an aggressive
telemarketing strategy advertising false connections to legitimate organizations and
environmental standards. Potential investors were offered a high return investment opportunity in
carbon credits. The firm is estimated to have defrauded Australian victims of $3.2 million. [39]

The FTAlphaville warned of a firm called “Enviro Associates” that was selling voluntary carbon
credits for investment purposes, all the while warning that:

Voluntary Carbon Credits were not designed to be purchased for investment purposes:
for that reason Carbon Credits (VERs) are not for all specifications of Investors due to
its high risk and undeveloped market landscape and uncertainty...

Individuals should be aware if they are purchasing for speculative means that there is
little or no liquidity at present in the market which in turn would affect your ability to
sell/exit from a holding at this time. This may change in the future. [40]

Enviro Associates claims to be a “clearing member” of Gemmax Solutions, a payments and
clearing service. Britain’s financial Conduct Authority warns, however, that:

Several unauthorized firms promoting and selling carbon credits are telling investors
that carbon Neutral Investments Limited (CNI) or Gemmax Solutions, firms authorized by

be protected as though they are dealing with an authorized firm. But this is incorrect. [41]
Without investor protection and regulatory oversight, carbon schemes continue to proliferate

Britain‘s financial Services Authority summarizes warnings to investors about carbon frauds and
emphasizes that they do not regulate carbon credits in the same manner as shares of stock.[42] Still,
investors flock to these green “investment” opportunities.

in November 2013, Britain’s FSA reported that it had shut down nineteen companies in the past
fifteen months for bilking roughly 1,500 investors out of 24 million pounds ($38.7 million)
through selling carbon credits to individual investors.[43]

The UK Insolvency Service said the firms mainly targeted the elderly with high pressure sales
techniques and promises of hefty returns of more than 40 percent. "Salesmen played on peoples'
keenness to ‘do their bit‘ to save the environment while making an investment at the same time,"
the Service said in a statement. [44]

The FCA in September released the findings of a survey of 125 carbon investors, showing not
one had made any money from investing in the credits.[45]

The watchdog said some 183 carbon firms have been put under investigation since 201 l and has
listed many of them on its website.[46]

In the US, carbon schemes have prompted several States Attorneys General, including those of
California, Vermont, Arkansas, Delaware, Maine, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Illinois, Connecticut
and New Hampshire, to back efforts by the Federal Trade Commission to investigate consumer
fraud in the carbon offsets market.[47]

B. Corporate Fraud

Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects generate carbon credits based on the extent to
which the project resulted in fewer emissions than would otherwise have occurred. Dan Welch,
of The Guardian, wrote, “Offsets are an imaginary commodity created by deducting what you
hope happens from what you guess would have happened.”[48]

Companies, therefore, have an incentive to either inflate the estimate of emissions that would
have occurred without the project or claim that the project will reduce emission by more than it
actually does.

In order to constrain firms from mischaracterizing their projects, the CDM mechanism requires
third-party validation and verification before a project receives carbon credits. Third-party
verification is carried out by Designated Operation Entities (DOES) certified by the CDM
Executive Board.

liven independent third party auditors, however, may be susceptible to bribes or collusion to
manipulate the results.

According to Transparency International, bribery is most common at the project approval stage.
“Although kickbacks to officials have not been reported, a Russian agency reportedly asked for
direct monetary payments. In South-east Asian countries, it is fairly common for developers to
invite the authorities to workshops (with attractive per diems) before submitting projects for
approval. In China, it is not uncommon for project developers to invite experts reviewing their
projects to dinner.”[49]

But even independent verification agencies are not immune to manipulation. In 2008 and 2009
respectively the UN temporarily suspended two independent organizations A Norwegian
company Det Norske Veritas and Swiss firm SGS — after “spot checks found flaws in their
methodologies.”[50] Investigations showed that both companies had approved projects without
sufficient review.“

“The UN inspection found one company had a flawed review process, inadequate preparation
and training of their auditing staff, and an overall failure to assign auditors with the proper
technical skills. The other was suspended after an inspection raised concerns about staff
qualifications and the quality of its internal reviews."52

In a follow-up review in 2009 the five largest DOEs’ validation processes were scored on an A-
to-F scale. None received a score higher than a D. [53]

C. Permit Fraud

1. Counterfeiting

There are many example of fake or invalid carbon permits being sold to unwitting buyers.

In one infamous and convoluted example, in March 2010, the Hungarian government took
possession of two million carbon credits which had been surrendered to them by Hungarian
businesses.

The rules of the EU—ETS allowed the Hungarian government to legally sell these carbon credits
to others because Hungary anticipated being below its Kyoto Protocol target. However, the EU
rules prevented these credits from being re-used within the EU.[54] Thus, Hungary sold the carbon
credits to Hungarian Energy Power, ‘with restrictions that they were ineligible for use in Europe
and notified the European Commission of the sale "55 “Hungarian Energy Power then sold the
credits to a British trading company, which resold them to a firm in Hong Kong The Hong Kong
firm however, then put those same recycled carbon credits on BlueNext, a Paris carbon
exchange“, where a number of European brokers and banks purchased them not knowing the
carbon credits had already been used in Europe.”57

When BlueNext discovered the credits were ineligible for use in the EU, the exchange
“immediately suspended trading sending the spot price for CERS spiraling downward.”58 After
shutting down for three days to isolate the problem credits, BlueNext facilitated “swap backs,”59
in which tae sellers bought back the credits. Prices rose to their previous levels when trading
reopened.[60]

While the European Commission has now closed the loophole that allowed the credits to re—enter
the EU-ETS,[61] the episode highlights the importance of“strong regulations for monitoring the
transfer of carbon credits through several foreign exchanges, particularly cross—checking between
those exchanges.”[62]

2. Theft

Carbon permits are also the target of hackers. A hacking attack in November of 2010 resulted in
the theft of 1.6 million carbon credits (valued at €235 million) from the Romanian registry
account of Holcim Ltd, the world’s second largest cement-maker.”[63] Holcim immediately posted
the identification numbers of the stolen credits on its website and law enforcement efforts
between Romania and Liechtenstein were able to track and return 600,000 of the stolen credits.64
Still, while the unique identification number of the carbon credits allowed them to be tracked,
not all the credits could be returned to Holcim. As it turned out, some “jurisdictions required the
holder to return the stolen credits to the legal owner at the holder’s loss, while other jurisdictions
allowed the buyer to keep them, with the original owner carrying the loss.”65

In another high-proflle incident, the European Union’s emissions trading system was shut down
for a week afler cyber—thieves stole emissions allowances worth €7m ($9.4m) from an account in
the Czech Republic, while criminals also hacked into trading accounts in Austria, Poland, Greece
and Estonia. “The Commission proposed tighter security measures in 2010 after discovering that
hackers had broken into the registries where allowances are stored,” but member states have
repeatedly claimed they cannot afford the improvements. [66] It is easy to imagine a similar
situation arising in US markets where states would have to bear such unexpected costs.

VI. Conclusion and Policy Recommendations

Economists agree, cap and trade does not work for carbon. So why do politicians continue to
pursue such mechanisms? It seems to me that while some paint “climate deniers" as a problem in
Congress, an equally troubling problem is “cap and trade failure deniers.” Perhaps politicians
think that adopting a “market” based solution will get them off the hook for tough decisions on
carbon tax rates. But, unfortunately for the rest of us, doing so only exposes the US economy to
new sources of fraud, theft, and risk of loss while raising energy prices WITHOUT reducing
carbon output.

In fact, the conclusions of the House of Commons, Energy and Climate Change Committee,
“The EU Emissions Trading System,” Tenth Report of Session 2010—l 2, Volume I, 17 January
2012 (at 129), summarize my testimony as well, if not better, than I can write on my own:

Some proponents of the ETS suggest that the main flows are rules that have been
designed inadequately or have been badly applied, and could be reformed. We suggest
that s are ofa structural nature. The ETS is a market in a commodity that has
been created by legislative/int. The European Commission is both the supplier and the
regulator of carbon as a commodity, a situation which has made the E TS particularlv
susceptible to rent—seeking behaviour. This should come as no surprise, since the history
ofemissions trading is littered with evidence that it helps companies and governments to
pre-empt and delay making the structural changes necessary to address climate
change.

This crucial task of reducing carbon emissions needs to be handled with care, lest we merely
repeat the mistakes already experienced by established markets. We can’t afford such setbacks.

Extending the analogy with central banking, members of Congress should remember that the
National Monetary Commission studies central bank functions around the world for seven years
before concluding upon the design of the US Federal Reserve System, having experienced two
failed central banks before it. Let’s take our time now and research existing carbon abatement
mechanisms before embarking upon another two (or more) failed schemes that will enrich
interest groups while continuing to allow carbon to grow as a national, and global, problem.

Follow-UpQuestions for Written Submission, Mason

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse

I. In your testimony you indicated that there is “virtually no disagreement among economists that the true cost to society of burning a ton of carbon is greater than its private costs.”
a. What is the true cost to society of burning a ton of carbon that is currently not accounted for in the private cost (i.e. social cost of carbon?

WE don't know the true social cost. That is why I followed the observation you noted in my written
testimony with the statement that “agreeing that the [social cost of CO2] is greater than zero isn’t
really agreeing on very much."

Indeed, the total social cost of future C02 output is the important question (even ignoring that
much of past developed-world growth and much of developing world growth stems from
underpriced CO2 externalities). The answer to that question begins embedded in estimates of the.
cost of future global warming associated with man-made CO2 output (including foregone economic
growth from curtailing CO: output). If the effects of CO2 upon global warming are nearer in time
and/or greater in magnitude, the social cost of CO2 is higher. But even scientific estimates vary
considerably in timing and magnitude, leading to estimates anywhere between $5 per ton and $200
per ton. A US government study put the cost at $20 per ton.[2] In truth, nobody knows the “right”
price.

Some economists argue that the social cost of CO2 should be reflective of a worst-case catastrophic
outcomc. While there is some logic to that approach the outcome of such analyses are unhelpful, since in extremis the resulting policy prescription is an infinite price on CO2, so high as to shut down all use altogether. Such reasoning is analogous to requiring banks to hold 100% capital to forestall another financial crisis, resulting in zero bank lending contribution to economic growth. Moreover, the other side of the extreme value distribution is that is not effect — while — while just a remote an outcome — suggests mitigating the prohibitively high policy bucket roughly the average.

Such reasoning is why economists like myself advocatc that if setting up a mechanism to address
CO@ at all, setting up a workable CO: mechanism that can adapt over time to the needs of society.
Such a mechanism is not that of the EU, California, or the RGGI, but a national (if not global)
mechanism that can balance the cost of abatement with the benefit of lower CO2 emissions in order
to respond to outcomes and scientific evidence, as those evolve. This system need not target a
“right” price, but should target a price that —- at least minimally ~ deters CO2 output at the margin.
Current systems are not workable and are not pricing CO@ at a level that even minimally deters
output. The current deterrent to CO2 output — political uncertainty - leads to widely disparate
estimates of carbon costs that, generally inhibits long-term investment in today‘s economy.

Follow-UpQuestions for Written Submission, Mason


 
2. Several Economists who served Republican Presidents including Henry Paulson (Secretary of the Treasury under President George W. Bush), Arthur Gaffer (economic Advisor under President Reagan), and George Shultz (Secretary of State under President Reagan and Secretary of Labor Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon), here expressed support for placing a price on carbon. In your testimony you stated that “if we want markets to reflect more dramatic outcomes we will have to use a carbon tax.” 

a. What is the best way to structure a carbon fee program? Specifically, please explain the sources that should be covered by the fee programs; point at the fee should be assessed (e.g. at the mine mouth, refinery gate); initial price per metric ton and rationale for selecting that price; rate and frequency at which the price should increase; the greenhouse gases (GHGs) to be covered and if the fee is assessed for GHGs besides carbon dioxide, how GHGs with higher global warming potentials (GWPS) should be treated (e.g. refrigerants with high GWPs); entity or entities that should administer and enforce the program; revenue use; and measures to protect energy intensive trade exposed industries that low-income Americans are not disproportionately affected.  

Related to the response above since we do not know the “right” price of carbon there is no “best"
way to structure a tax on CO2 or other greenhouse gases.

In fact. it could be that even a small tax nowhere near the “best” tax — may have drastic effects on
energy use, obviating the need for the “best" solution. There are myriad examples in economics of
small user fees — well below the economic costs of the activities — changing significantly consumer
and business behavior and reducing disproportionately the magnitude. of undesirable activities, It
could be, therefore, that a small tax on carbon ~ applied to the right segments of the economy v
could have dramatic effects.

That said, we economists know that: the effects of any charges are equivalent to a tax in that they
reduce the targeted economic activity. If those reyenues are used to fund offsetting activities, they
can -— in theory — be neutral to economic growth. In practice, revenues derived from CO2 programs
hate instead been used to pay off prior budget deficits, rendering the taxes a drag on economic
growth.

The last portion of the question —- focusing on “protecting energy-intensive trade exposed
industries and ensuring that low income Americans are not disproportionately affected" —
deserves special attention. Blanket energy subsidies worldwide have been associated with high
energy use. In fact, it has been established that such subsidies benefit the rich much more than the
poor, because the rich use more subsidized energy in response to subsidies, while the demand from
the poor remains relatively inelastic since they are always economizing. Research from the IMF
suggests that the richest 20% get more than 40% o of the benefits from energy subsidies, roughly six
times the share of the bottom 20%[3] Recently, some countries have targeted their energy subsidies
to remove the benefit for the rich and preserve the help for the poor, but that has taken extreme
political courage on the part of those nation’s politicians.[4] Nonetheless, the effect on energy usage
has already been dramatic.

Follow-Up Questions for Written Submission
Senator David Vitter

You are likely aware that Germany is now building new coal fired power plants to meet their caseload energy needs. As well, Germany is looking at lifting their ban on hydraulic fracturing so their companies can be more competitive and receive the the feedstock that makes building virtually anything possible. Why is Germany doing this?

Germany is looking back at conventional energy sources because (1) they need sources to replace
the nuclear they are phasing out and (2) their subsidized wind and solar are expensive conventional
alternatives. In 2013 Germany experienced a sharp increase in electricity prices as a result of
€20.4bn in “feed-in” subsidies for green energy" paid for out of consumer electricity bills. In 2013,
the mandatory surcharge electricity rose from 3.6 cents per kWh to a record 5.3 cents per kWh. For
a typical household using 3500 kWh per year, this surcharge rose from €125 to roughly €185

The increase raised consumer’ ire because manv businesses are exempted from the surcharge, in
in order to protect their “international competitiveness.

Such subsidies certainly increased investment in green alternatives, but at the inevitable expense of
higher energy costs.

 But the subsidies have also skewed investment in ways that do not adequately serve Germany’s
energy needs. “there is now so much renewable power available at certain times of day that it meets
a significant part of demand,” but renewables like wind and solar are unreliable. As a result utilities
need to keep conventional sources of electricity generation, such as gas and coal, operational as
back-ups.“

According to Jason Channell, alternative energy and cleantech analyst at Citi, those backups need to
be paid for, too and utilities “expect a capacity payment mechanism from regulators to compensate
them for the low utilisation rates.[7]

These demand shifts have formed over the past several years so much so that they have skewed
long-term investment decisions, According to the financial Times “Demand for coal from power
generators has soared over the past two years as that for cleaner natural gas has shrunk, the reason
being price, In Europe, natural gas is generally sold on contracts linked to the oil price, which is still
relatively strong. Meanwhile, coal usage has been encouraged by low prices for burning carbon
under the EUs carbon-trading scheme as the eurozone crisis has led to a {all in demand [for CO2
permits.] Ample supplies of coal on the back of exports from North America -~ where the shale gas
boom has pushed natural gas prices to lO-year lows this year - have also lowered prices, making coal
much more competitive.”

in short, Germany got caught in a tangled web of subsidies and perverse incentives that are now
actually raising its CO2 output, instead of shrinking it. Again the EU’s cap and trade system and
sovereign subsidies are not working to reduce CO2 output and, in my opinion, do not provide a

framework we should emulate in the [15.

2.It is my understanding that youth unemployment in the uK stands at almost 21% reached 26% in France last year, and Spain’s is even worse at over 56%. All the countries promised that their carbon regulations and energy mandates would be a boon to their economies and opportunities for young adults. Unfortunately, the exact opposite is the case. How will the President’s plan to cap energy use impede economic activity and future opportunities for our young adults?

There seems to be a vast disconnect between energy jobs and policy. Wind turbines, solar panels,
and battery storage” are generally not items that: are produced in the U.S. but primarily come from
companies in the Asia/Pacific region. Some companies — particularly those from China — bring in
their own installation and maintenance crews from overseas. again detracting from employment in
such sectors in the US. Thus, employment opportunities have not been found in wind and solar.

There may be jobs in biofuels as loggers cut down forests to fuel European power plants. I would
argue that such gains are fleeting and not green. anyway, so that they do not count to meeting
environmental goals but only stand as perverse remnants of failed CO2 policies.

But the biggest source of jobs associated with lowering CO2 output is unfashionable and
disincentivized in the U.S. If we are to move U.S. power generation to more renewables and lower-
CO2 sources, our energy infrastructure will have to change. But projects like the Keystone Pipeline
remain mired in the same bureaucratic morass as energy policy, overall, while jobs suffer and U.S.
firms cannot take advantage of cheap natural gas as a step toward cleaner energy’ generation.

 As a result, we are moving backward. toward less developed countries as firms “focus on embedded
generation, produced on site where you can control your own energy costs." according to Ben
Warren, energy and environmental infrastructure leader at Ernst & Young.[10] As a result. we “will
still need some form of centralized infrastructure to help provide back—up generation." says Mr. 
Warren.[11] 

But even the jobs involved in building infrastructure are no longer incentivized by an education
policy that tries to send every child to college, whether they are suited for higher education or not
(as well, as a university “industry” that continues to market that message, as well). Our educational
system has deemphasized technical training so much that the demand is partially met by fly-by—night
for-profit “colleges” that do not focus on students’ interests and needs. Some of the successes from
technical employment are described in a recent Wall Street journal article. “This Way Up: Mobility
in America: Economic mobility is alive and well for Americans who pursue technical or practical
training.”

One example used in the article is the welding profession. According to the Wall Street journal,
“The average age in the field is 54, and the American Welding Society predicts openings for more

" Whilc battery storage is “green” from the perspective of CO2, it is not green from the perspective of heavy
metals pollution and ground water. Real green policies would balance clean air and clean water needs by
addressing all sorts of environmental threats.

than 400,000 workers by 2024 — welders and others who need welding skills, such as pipe fitters,
plumbers and boilermakers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs the average wage at $36,300 a year,
but anecdotal evidence suggests that is the low end of what's possible. JV Industrial says that it pays
more like $75,000. with some employees earning more than $100,000. In the Burgeoning shale
industry, in Texas and Appalachia, welders can earn as much as $7,000 a week.”[12] My (late) father
owned a welding school. I learned to weld in my teens. I can say from first—hand experience that the
Wall Street Journal‘s description is entirely correct. But such important lessons seem lost on
Washington.

So while there may be jobs for US. employees in the new clean energy sector, those have yet to be
realized and U.S. education policies AND the proposed new energy policies push them further out
of reach of many Americans.

1. Does raising the cost of energy affect poor people more than it affects wealthy people? Please explain. 

 Yes. The reason is that energy expenditures are not elastic for poor people — they already spend as
little as they can afford on energy whereas others hare a more elastic demand — they can switch to
public transportation or cut out unnecessary transportation or home energy expenditures in
response to higher costs;

As a result, it is widely accepted worldwide that “mitigating measures to protect the poor” are
required in response to rising energy costs, especially when removing energy subsidies to promote
more efficient energy use and higher economic productivity. ”

In the past several years, Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Yemen have
started reforming energy subsidies “by increasing energy prices while mitigating the impact on the
poor. In most cases reforms have been part of a broad-based fiscal strategy to reduce fiscal deficits
and free resources to be put toward social spending and infrastructure—Which could help boost
growth and reduce poverty and inequality.”[14] All such programs have required a scaling up “well—
targeted social safety nets to compensate those who will be hardest hit by higher prices,“[15] The US,
should expect to undertake similar policies if we choose to increase energy costs.

 

2. Is a government mandate requiring business to spend money to clean up the environment, in an economic sense, little different than the government raising taxes and then using that money to carry out the environmental improvements?

Assuming the expenditures are the same — in both magnitude and substance — the only difference
arises from government overhead in administering the taxes and selecting projects and awarding
funds,

That said, neither business nor the government is very good at carrying out environmental
improvements themselves‘ and both should be left to manage their core competencies.

A good example of the government requiring firms to provide products and services outside their
core product area is from banking is the Community Reinvestment Act where all banks were
required to make loans to lower-income consumers. While the goal of providing credit to such
consumers is laudable, not ALL banks are good at that business. After decades of problems,
Regulators and Congress finally acquiesced to that reality and allowed banks to make investments in
lenders who specialized those product segments in order to meet the goals of the regulation.

Thus, inevitably there will be a layer of administration with regard to the environmental projects to
be funded by such levies. It may be best to motivate the economy, itself, to create an industry
serving the demand for such environmental projects[16], rather than expecting disparate businesses to
undertake such projects on their own or adding new layers of government overhead to administer
the distribution of such levies.


[6] In order to foster efficiency in such an industry, one could take a lesson from charities and award greater
credit to those with the most effective outcomes and the lowest overhead costs (in terms of the, amount of
funds contributed that go to administrative overhead versus the core mission of the charity).

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Dr. Mason. 
Let me begin with a question prompted by Administrator 
Ruckelshaus’ testimony. Mr. Ruckelshaus, you described a number 
of environmental improvements that took place on our watch. You 
mentioned that inherent in all was powerful economic interests re-
sisting controls, to use your phrase. 

You said that in all of the cases cited, the solutions to the prob-
lems did not result in the predicted economic and social calamity. 
Each of you has had the firsthand experience of having to make 
decisions that were surrounded by fears and anxieties about per-
haps dire consequences of your decision. Each of you has made that 
decision, each has seen the consequences as they played out in the 
aftermath. 

My question to each of you, starting with Mr. Ruckelshaus whose 
testimony I think probably foretells his answer, how did the worst 
fears and assumptions of bad outcomes from environmental regula-
tions turn out in reality as the rules were applied in your own ex-
perience? Mr. Ruckelshaus? 

Mr. RUCKELSHAUS. Let me mention just one example. The Con-
gress, in 1970, passed the Clean Air Act which provided that in the 
law itself by 1975, the cars would be 95 percent improved in three 
named pollutants in the law—hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and 
nitrogen oxide. 

The claim of the automobile companies was that this was impos-
sible to do by 1975. I think they probably were right about that. 
It was an overly ambitious goal set by the Congress. 

As Administrator, I was authorized to give them a 1-year exten-
sion from the meeting of those 1975 goals if the facts warranted. 
We had extensive hearings and decided, in the first instance, not 
to grant an extension and in the second instance, an extension was 
granted. 

By 1976, with the use of the catalyst, most of the automobile 
companies were on the way to achieving the standards as required 
by the statute. 

The claims during those hearings and during the passage of the 
laws were that the industry was going to collapse. Ford Motor 
Company predicted they would have to shut down their whole com-
pany if this law passed. 

There was enough flexibility in the law, enough chance to give 
them the kind of leeway they needed to achieve the standards. 
Once they saw the rule was serious and we were going to pursue 
as vigorously as we could the achievement of the requirements 
under the law in the rule, then they began to focus on reducing the 
cost. 

The motivation of trying to resist the regulation, resist the law 
that was passed by the Congress, changed from one of claiming the 
end was near to one of let us see if we can do this and do it in 
a cost effective way. 

They did do it in a cost effective way and we achieve the stand-
ards finally. It was later than they expected. There was some lee-
way granted by the Congress after the original law. 
We have almost three times as many cars on the road today and 
the emissions from the automobiles are 95 percent reduced.

Senator WHITEHOUSE. In my remaining minute, let me ask you 
to fill in and if we have a second round, I will come back and finish 
the question with the others but I am running out of time. 

Ms. WHITMAN. Probably the best example I can give is when we 
were working on increasing the efficiency of air conditioners. We 
were being sued by everyone, including the DOE, saying it was ab-
solutely impossible, that this was going to kill the industry. 
We went ahead and found one company that said, no, we can do 
this. Carrier Air Conditioning said they could do it. They did it and 
started producing the more highly efficient air conditioners. Now 
everyone has exceeded those rules. We took them to 11 percent; 
they are now talking about 23 percent ratings. 

The ingenuity in the American system kicked in. The minute 
they knew this was real, it was going to happen not only did we 
not see a loss in jobs or loss in dollars, we saw this whole industry 
achieve new levels that we did not think were possible. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. With my time expired, let me turn to my 
distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Sessions. 

Senator SESSIONS. Thank you. 
We certainly have made some great progress in the air in Amer-
ica and the water is so much cleaner than it has been. When we 
see situations in China, we are proud of what we have accom-
plished. 

However, I would say CO2 is a different kettle of fish. It is not 
particulates and NOx and SOx. It is plant food and it is not a pol-
lutant in any normal definition of it, although Governor Whitman, 
I will acknowledge the Supreme Court by a 5–4 ruling ruled other-
wise based on IPCC data. 

Mr. Chairman, I would offer the letter to Gina McCarthy from 
West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey regarding EPA’s 
asserted authority under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to reg-
ulate CO2 emissions from existing coal fired power plants and a 
white paper from 17 attorneys general and one senior environ-
mental regulator to another State regarding the authority of States 
under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to determine standards 
as applied to individual sources. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Without objection, those documents will be 
made a part of our record.

Re: EPA’s Asserted Authority Under Section 11.1(d) Of The Clean Air Act To
Regulate C02 Emissions From Existing Coal—fired Power Plants

Dear Administrator McCarthy:

On June 2, 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) launched
one of the most far-reaching and expensive regulatory projects in American history: the Carbon
Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units
(“Proposed Rule").] The Proposed Rule seeks to impose limitations on C0; emitted from
existing coal-fired power plants, requiring a staggering 30% reduction in the emissions from
these plants across the country in a more 15 years. West Virginian, a major consumer of coal-
generated electricity and one of the leading producers of coal—-will be uniquely harmed by the
restrictions of the Proposed Rule.

As the chief legal officer for the State of West Virginia, I respectfully request that you
withdraw the Proposed Rule immediately because EPA lacks the legal authority to adopt that
Rule. In the Legal Memorandum for Proposed Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for
Existing Electric Utility Generating Units (“Legal Memorandum” or “Mem,”) that was issued
together with and incorporated by reference into the Proposed Rule,[2] EPA offers only one legal
basis for the Rule: the rarely invoked Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). See 42
U.S.C. § 741 1(d). The problem is that Section 111(d) affirmatively excludes precisely what EPA
is attempting to do in the Proposed Rule.

1 The Rule has not yet been published in the Federal Register and is currently available at
http://wwwz.epa.gov/sites/productioMiles/2014»05/documents/20l40602proposal—cleanpowerplan.pdf.

As this letter explains, EPA lacks authority under the plain text of Section lll(d), as it
appears in the United States Code, to promulgate the Proposed Rule. Section 111(d) expressly
prohibits EPA from regulating “any air pollutant . . . emitted from a[n] [existing] source category
which is regulated under {the national emission regime in Section 112 of the CAA}.” 42
USC. § 7411(d). Given that EPA has imposed extensive and onerous regulations on existing
coal—fired power plants under Section 112, the agency cannot now use Section 111(d) to require
regulation of C02 emissions from those same existing plants. This conclusion is so apparent that
even EPA concedes in its Legal Memorandum that a “literal reading” ofSection 111(d) prohibits
the Proposed Rule. Mom. 26; see also 70 Fed. Reg. 15,994, 16,032 (Mar. 29, 2005) (EPA
making the same admission in a prior rulemaking),

The only textual justification that EPA’s Legal Memorandum offers for departing from
the “literal” terms of Section 111(d) is unpersuasive. The agency relies entirely on a one-
sentence clerical entry in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act that was not codified in the
US. Code but appears in the Statutes at Large. That entry, even EPA has admitted, was clearly a
mistake because it sought to make a technical correction rendered moot by another amendment.
See 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031 (describing the entry as a “drafting error”). Nevertheless, EPA now
claims that it must give meaning to this mistake and, as a result, has announced an interpretation
of Section 111(d) that directly conﬂicts with the language in the US. Code. EPA’s interpretation
rewrites Section 111(d) from a prohibition on the regulation of "any air pollutant . . . emitted
from a source category which is regulated under [Section 1 12],” as stated in the [1.8. Code, to a
more limited prohibition on the regulation of “any hazardous air pollutant” emitted from such a
source category. This sort of reasoning would be wrong under any circumstance, but it is
particularly improper here, where it is being offered as the justification for one of the most costly
regulations in this Nation’s history.

in light of the profound legal infirmities with the Proposed Rule, EPA‘S unprecedented
policy will not survive judicial review. As such, it would be contrary to the public interest to
proceed with publication in the Federal Register. Failure to withdraw the Proposed Rule will
only cause citizens, States, industry, and environmental groups to waste valuable resources
analyzing and commenting on a futile endeavor. Moreover. given the short timeframe for
compliance with the Rule’s objectives, many of these parties will be required to incur significant
and unnecessary costs. This will trigger unwarranted market responses and economic dislocation
from coerced reduction of the use of coal as parties struggle to meet the anticipated requirements.
This is unacceptable. No matter how fervent the desire by some to advance the policies
underlying these regulations, EPA cannon—and should not do so at the expense of the rule of
law.

A. EPA Has Conceded That The Proposed Rule Is Unlawful Under The “Literal”
Terms Of The Clean Air Act

The only authority invoked by EPA for the onerous requirements in the Proposed Rule is
Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, a little-used provision that grants EPA limited power to
require States to regulate air pollutants from existing sources. Mom. 11—12. As it appears in the
US. Code, Section lll(d) requires the EPA Administrator under narrow circumstances to

Page 218

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 3

“prescribe regulations which shall establish a procedure , . . under which each State shall submit
to the Administrator a plan which establishes standards of performance” for certain existing
sources and certain air pollutants. Among other things, the statutory provision specifically
excludes from the Administrator’s authority the power to prescribe regulations relating to
“standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant . . . emitted from a source
category which is regulated under section 7412 of this title 1118., Section 112 of the CAA].” 42
U ,S.C. § 7411(d). EPA admits in its Legal Memorandum for the Proposed Rule that “a literal
reading of that language” means that “EPA c[an] not regulate any air pollutant from a source
category regulated under section 1 12” of the Clean Air Act. Mem. 26 (emphasis added); accord
70 Fed. Reg. at 16,032 (EPA reaching the same conclusion). Simply put, Section 1 11(d)’s plain
text provides that if an existing source category is regulated under Section 112, that source
category may not also be regulated under Section 1 11(d).

The regime codified in Sections 112 and 111 is part of a measured, coherent approach to
regulating air pollutants from new and existing pollution sources. Section 112 01‘ the Clean Air
Act concerns national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants (“HAPs”) emitted from
any number of new and existing sources. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412. Whether a source category is
regulated under Section 112 is generally dependent upon a number of factors. Id §7412(c).
With regard to coal-fired power plants, Congress specially provided that those sources need only
be regulated under Section 112 if the Administrator finds such regulation to be “appropriate and
necessary.” Id. § 7412(n). Section 111(d) in turn addresses the emission of air pollutants emitted
from existing sources not regulated under Section 112. Specifically, when EPA has chosen not
to regulate a source category nationally under Section 112, emissions from existing sources
within that category must be subject instead to state-by-state emission standards under Section
111(d), assuming certain other predicates have been satisfied. The rest of Section 11 l, which is
not at issue here, is not restricted by the scope of Section 112 and concerns national emissions
standards for air pollutants emitted from new sources.

In the present case, it is clear that EPA has no authority under Section 111(d) to regulate
“any” emission from coal—fired power plants, including C02 emissions. EPA categorized coal-
fired power plants as part of a “source category” under Section 112 in 2000, see 65 Fed. Reg.
79,825, 79,826 (Dec. 20, 2000), and the DC. Circuit in 2008 rejected EPA’s attempt to withdraw
that finding, see New Jersey in EPA, 517 F.3d 574 (DC. Cir. 2008). Then, in 2012, EPA
imposed significant Section 112 restrictions on coal-fired power plants. see 77 Fed. Reg. 9,304
(Feb. 16, 2012); 40 C.F.R. Part 63 subpart UUUUU, which the DC. Circuit recently upheld, see
also White Stallion Energy Cm, LLC v. EPA, 1‘ F.3d._, 2014 WL 1420294 (DC. Cir. Apr. 15.
2014). Under the “literal” reading of Section 111(d), Mom. 26, these rules regulating existing
coal-fired power plants under Section 112 prohibit EPA from invoking Section 111(d) to adopt
the Proposed Rule.

B. EPA’s Arguments Based Upon A Clerical “Drafting Error” In The 1990 Clean Air
Act Amendments Cannot Displace The “Literal” Terms Of Section 111(d)

Faced with the unambiguous terms of Section 1 11(d) in the US. Code, EPA falls back in
its Legal Memorandum to an erroneous prior analysis that the agency conducted in 2005, in

Page 219

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 4

which it concluded that Section 111(d) is actually “ambiguous" and therefore subject to the
agency’s “reasonable" interpretation. Mem. 8, 26, That 2005 analysis which was part of a rule
under Section lll(d) that the DC. Circuit vacated in New Jersey v. EPA, 5i 7 F.3d 574—based
its conclusion entirely upon a clerical entry in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act that
was not codified in the US. Code but appears in the Statutes at Large. According to EPA, the
1990 Amendments included two entries relevant to Section 111(d). Both entries appear in the
Statutes at Large, but only the first amendment—described by EPA as the “substantive” one—w
was incorporated into the (5.8. Code. EPA argues that the mere existence of the second, clerical
amendment creates an ambiguity sufficient to call into doubt the language of Section 111(d) in
the US. Code. EPA’s attempt to displace the plain terms of Section lll9d) was wrong in 2005
and remains so today.

1. The Clerical “Drafting Error” In The 1990 CleanAir Act Amendments Does Not
Create An Ambiguity In The Terms Q/‘Section I 1 Md)

As a threshold matter, EPA’s analysis is wrong because the one-sentence clerical entry
referred to by EPA falls far short of the showing necessary to cast doubt on the plain terms of
Section 111(d) as they appear in the US. Code. The “Code of Laws of the United States current
at any time shall . , . establish prima facie the laws of the United States.” 1 U.S.C. § 204(a). As
“prima facie“ evidence, the language of Section 111(d) in the US Code is displaced only where
the US. Code is “inconsistent” with the Statutes at Large. See Stephan v. United States, 319
US. 423, 426 (1943). There is no inconsistency here.

A review of the two relevant entries in the Statutes at Large reveals that the clerical entry
does not create an ambiguity or inconsistency, but rather is—A-as even EPA has admitted—a
“drafting error [that] should not be considered.” 70 Fed, Reg. at 16,031.

The first relevant entry appears in the Statutes at Large among a list of other entries
making substantive amendments to Section ill. Prior to these amendments in 1990, Section
1 1 ltd) had prohibited EPA from requiring state—by-state regulation of any air pollutant on the list
of HAPs published under Section llZ(b)(l)(A). This particular amendment made a significant
substantive change by replacing the reference to “l l2(b)(l)(A)" with the language that now
appears in the US. Code-“emitted from a source category which is regulated under section
llZ." Pub. L. No. 101-549, § 108(g), 104 Stat. 2399, 2467 (1990). As a result, the restriction in
Section 11 l(d) changed from one focused on HAPs regulated under Section H2 to one focused
instead on source categories regulated under that section.

The second relevant entry appears much later in the Statutes at Large among a list of
purely clerical changes — entitled “Conforming Amendments." Pub. L, No. 101-549, §302(a),
104 Stat, 2399, 2474 (1990). As explained in the Senate‘s Legislative Drafting Manual,
"Conforming Amendments” are “amendments of a provision of law that [are] necessitated by
the substantive amendments or provisions of the bill.” Senate Legislative Drafting Manual
§ l26(b)(2)(A). They effectuate the sorts of ministerial changes required to clean up a statute
after it has been substantively amended. Thus, conforming amendments “include[] amendments,

Page 220

The Honorable Gina McCarthy

Page 5

such as amendments to the table of contents, that formerly may have been designated as clerical
amendments." Id

Consistent with its description as a conforming amendment, this particular entry sought
simply to bring up to date the cross-reference in Section 111(d) to Section 1 12(b)(1)(A). Other
amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990 had eliminated Section 112(b)(l)(A) entirely and
replaced it with Sections 112(b)(1), 112(b)(2), and 112(b)(3). This clerical amendment was
designed solely to account for those changes. Specifically, it provided that “Section 111(d)(1) of
the Clean Air Act is amended by striking ‘[l 12](b)(1)(A)’ and inserting in lieu thereof
‘[112](b).’” Pub. L. No. 101-549, § 302(3). Unlike the substantive amendment described above,
this non—substantive amendment would not have changed the restriction in Section 111(d) from
its pre-l990 focus on hazardous air pollutants regulated under Section 1 12.

In light of the substantive amendment, however, the second non-substantive amendment
was clearly an unnecessary mistake or, as EPA has put it, a “drafting error.” When the
conforming amendment is applied after the substantive amendment, as is required by the very
nature of conforming amendments, there is no clerical correction left to make because the cross—
reference to 112(b)(1)(A) has already been removed by the substantive amendment. This is
consistent with the codifier's notation in the US. Code that the clerical amendment "could not be
executed.” Revisor’s Note, 42 U.S.C. § 7411. Where a conforming amendment is entirely
unnecessary, it is rightly understood as a clerical mistake that need not be given any effect, See
Am, Petroleum Ins]. 1!. SEC, 714 F.3d 1329, 1336-37 (DC. Cir. 2013).

EPA has correctly recognized as much—noting in 2005, for example, that the clerical
entry “is a drafting error and therefore should not be considered”~—but it then wrongly
determined that it nevertheless “must attempt to give effect to both the [substantive] and
[clerical] [entries], as they are both part of the current law." 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031; accord
Mem. 21 (recognizing “apparent drafting errors during enactment of the 1990 CAA
Amendments”). This fundamental ﬂaw dooms EPA’s analysis. As the DC. Circuit recently
explained, where a mistake in renumbering a statute and correcting a cross-reference conflicts
with substantive provisions of that statute, the mistake should be considered most likely “the
result of a scrivener’s errorﬂ“ and should not be treated as “creating an ambiguity." Am.
Petroleum, 714 F.3d at 1336-37. Under this reasoning, it is clear that the clerical entry simply
“should not be considered," as EPA originally concluded. 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031. At the very
minimum, the existence of such a non—substantive. “drafting error” is not enough to overcome
the fact that language codified in the U.S. Code is "prima facie” evidence of “the laws of the
United States.” 1 U.S.C. §204(a).

Put another way. EPA now asserts that the non-substantive and substantive
amendments—if each were implemented into Section 111(d)’s prior text standing alone—would
create two separate versions of Section 111(d), Mom, 24. The first version incorporates only the
non-substantive amendment and therefore retains the pro-1990 prohibition on regulating HAPS
under Section 111(d), regardless of whether the source category emitting those HAPs is
regulated under Section 112. The second version is the one that actually appears in the U.S.

Code and substantively changes the prohibition to forbidding EPA from regulating under Section
111(d) any air pollutants emitted by any existing source regulated under Section 112. Mem. 24.

But this approach of treating both amendments as, in effect, creating two different
version of l 11(d) directly contradicts EPA’S concession that the inclusion of the non-substantive
entry in the Statutes at Large was merely a clerical “drafting error.” Critically, the only evidence
EPA may use in its attempt to rebut the terms of Section 111(d) as expressed in the U .8. Code is
the Statutes at Large, see Stephan, 319 US. at 426, and the Statutes at Large simply do not
re act two separate versions of Section 111(d). Rather. they reflect only two amendments~one
a substantive change and one a mere clerical entry—~and the clerical entry is rendered moot by
the substantive amendment.3

2. EPA ‘5' Policy Arguments Cream No Ambiguity In Section 111(d)

EPA’s policy arguments against the “literal” terms of Section lll(d) also cannot
generate an ambiguity where none exists in the plain statutory text. As a threshold matter, even
if EPA were correct that the “literal" terms of Section 111(d) produce overly harsh results for
EPA’S regulatory authority, EPA may not “redraft a statute in order to avoid what
the agency characterized as the ‘absurd results‘ that would ﬂow from the statute’s language”
where it is, as here, “‘not inconceivable that Congress meant what the statute says?” Ass'n of
Am. RRS. v. Surface Tramp. 8d, 162 F.3d 101, 105 (DC. Cir. 1998) (quoting Mova
Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Shalala. l40 F.3d 1060. 1072 (DC. Cir. 1998)). In any event, EPA’S
policy arguments miss the mark because the “literal” terms of Section 111(d) are part of a
rational regulatory scheme.

This regime quite logically avoids subjecting existing sources to both new national
standards for hazardous pollutants under Section 112 as well as new state-by—state standards
under Section 111, while permitting regulation under both Section 111 and Section 112 of new
sources. Unlike with new sources, the imposition of additional regulatory burdens on existing
sources raises questions of fairness and lost investments, as existing sources that were built under
a different regulatory regime may or may not have the technological or financial ability to come
into compliance with two sets of new rules. Indeed, both Sections 1 12 and l 1 1(d) recognize that
the cost of compliance must be weighed against maximum achievable reductions. See 42 U.S.C.

3 Although some had argued in 2005 and 2008 that the clerical entry should take precedence over the substantive
entry, EPA repeatedly and properly rejected those arguments as having “no merit.“ final Brief of Respondent EPA.
New Jersey v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574 (DC. Cir. 2008), 2007 W1, 2155494. at *103 n.33; accord 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031-
32. For example, the agency has explained that the so-called “last in point of arrangement“ rule of statutory
construction "is inapplicable here, as it applies to discrete sections of the same Act, not competing amendments to
the same section of an Act, as is the case here.” 2007 W1, 2155494, at ‘5103 n.33. Indeed, EPA emphaticallv
declared that it is “hard to conceive“ that Congress would have intended to give effect to the clerical change over the
substantive change, because, among other things, only the substantive change gives meaning to Section
112(n)(l)(A), which was also adopted during the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act. Section 112(n)(l)(A)
required EPA to conduct a study to determine whether coal-fired power plants “should even be regulated under
section 1 12." 70 Fed. Reg. at 15,995. As EPA recognized, this provision is strong evidence that Congress did not
wish to subject such power plants to “duplicative or overlapping regulation." but rather sought to force EPA to
choose between regulating power plants as a source category under Section l12 or 111(d). consistent with the
substantive change and not the clerical one. Id. at 16,031.

Page 222

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 7

§§ 7411(a)(1), 741 1(d), 7412(d). in establishing this regime, under which regulation of existing
sources occurs either under Section 112 or Section 111(d), Congress properly determined that
requiring the same existing source categories to comply with two functionally—independent
regulatory regimes would threaten these sources’ economic viability. Indeed, EPA has recently
imposed costly regulations on coal~fired power plants, which will cost those plants more than $9
billion dollars per year. See EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis for the final Mercury and Air
Toxics Standards at 3-13 (Dec. 2011), available at http://www.epa.gov/mt/ecas/regdata/RIAS
/matsriafinal.pdf‘, EPA’s Proposed Rule would subject those same plants to billions of dollars of
additional costs, through the imposition of duplicative regulatory requirements, forcing many of
those plants to close. That is the exact scenario Congress intended to avoid when it amended
Section 111(d).

in light of this understanding, EPA’s policy arguments in favor of ignoring Section
111(d)’s plain language are insubstantial.

EPA first claims that a “literal reading” of Section 111(d) would be contrary to
“Congress’ desire in the 1990 CAA Amendments to require EPA to regulate more substances.”
Mem. 25-26. But the mere fact that one of the broad purposes behind the 1990 Amendments
was to require EPA to regulate more substances under Section 112 does not mean that Congress
was not cognizant of other values, such as the need to avoid costly double regulation. In fact—
as EPA itself admitted in its 2005 analysis — the text, structure, and history of the 1990
Amendments indicates a desire by Congress to limit EPA’s ability to doubly regulate coal-fired
power plants, As explained above, the discussion and ultimate adoption of Section 112(n)(l)(A)
“reveals” that Congress did not want to subject coal—fired power plants to “duplicative or
otherwise inefficient regulation” 70 Fed. Reg. at 15,999. It is perfectly reasonable to understand
Section 111(d) as seeking to forward this same general goal of avoiding duplicative regulation.

EPA’s other policy argument is “the fact that the EPA has historically regulated non—
HAPs under section 111(d), even where those air pollutants were emitted from a source category
actually regulated under section 112.” Mem. 26. But it is no answer to the unambiguous textual
requirement in the 1990 Amendments to point to EPA‘s pre-amendmemnt practice of regulating
non—l'lAPs under Section 111(0). EPA at one time enjoyed the power of regulating existing
source categories on separate regulatory tracks. See Mcm. 9-10 & n. 17. When Congress
amended the Clean Air Act in 1990 to require EPA to regulate more HAP’s under Section 112,
however, Congress sensibly paired that increased power with a textual limitation—embodied in
Section 111(d}—against using that enhanced authority to impose duplicative regulations on the
same existing source categories. EPA’s argument that the “literal" terms of Section 111(d)
would hamstring it from using a provision that it has only used to regulate “four pollutants from
live source categories” in “forty years," Mem. 9, cannot possibly provide a basis for disregarding
the literal terms of the Clean Air Act.

3. EPA's Attempt To Resolve The Supposed Ambiguity Is Nevertheless
Impermissible

Even if the clerical error created an ambiguity in Section lll(d)’s “literal” text, EPA’s
analysis would still fail. To begin with, the agency’s claim to some unidentified form of
“deference“ for its attempt to rewrite Section lll(d) is meritless. Mem. 12. Courts defer to
agencies under the test set forth in Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc, 467 U .S. 837 (1984), because there is reason to believe that when Congress “left ambiguity
in a statute,” it “understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the
agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion
the ambiguity allows." Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), NA, 517 U .S. 735, 740—741 (1996).
EPA could not possibly argue that Congress intended EPA to resolve the import of Congress’s
inadvertent clerical “drafting error.” Indeed, EPA does not so argue. EPA offers no justification
whatsoever for its bald assertion that it is entitled to deference on this issue, and does not even
cite to Chevron in its discussion of the issue.

In any event, EPA could not possibly prevail under Chevron—fir some other similar form
of deference—because it offers an “impermissible construction” of the supposedly ambiguous
statute. Aid Ass'n for Lutherans v. US. Postal Serra, 321 F.3d 1166, 1178 (DC. Cir. 2003).
EPA would interpret Section 111(d) as follows: "Where a source category is regulated under
section 112, a section 111(d) standard of performance cannot be established to address any HAPS
listed under section 112(1)) that may be entitled from that particular source category.” Mem. 26.
This is flatly inconsistent with the substantive provision, embodied in the US, Code, that EPA
may not “establish“ standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant . . .
emitted from a source category which is regulated under [Section 112 of the CAM.” 42
U.S.C. § 741 Md) (emphasis added). EPA’s proffered interpretation effectively replaces the term
“any air pollutant" with the term “hazardous air pollutant." Even under Chevron, an agency is
not entitled to deference when its interpretation is so “manifestly contrary to the statute.” Mayo
Found. for Med. Educ. & Research v. United States, 131 S. Ct. 704, 711 (2011) (internal
quotations omitted); accord Peril v. US. Dep’t of Educ., 675 F.3d 769, 785 (DC. Cir. 2012).

If EPA wanted to give effect to its view of both the substantive and the clerical entries in
the Statutes at Large—which, as explained above, EPA nonsensically claims create two versions
of Section 111(d}-without impermissibly changing the text of either, it could have done so. As
one commentator has explained, all of EPA’s textual concerns could be satisfied by interpreting
Section 111(d) to prohibit the regulation of “any air pollutant . . . which is not included on a list
published under .. .112(b) [revision of the prior version of Section lll(d) after inputting the
clerical entry] or emitted from a source category which is regulated under section 1 12 [revision
of the prior version of Section 111(d) after inputting the substantive entry].” William J. Haun,
The Clean Air Act as an Obstacle to the Environmental Protection Agency is Anticipated Attempt
to Regulate Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Power Plants, 14 Engage: J. Federalist
Soc’y Prac. Groups 35, 38 (Mar. 2013) (parentheticals revised). EPA does not — and could not——
dispute that this is the only interpretation that gives full effect and meaning to every word of both
“versions" of Section 111(d) that it believes the Statutes at Large embodies. Accordingly. to the
extent EPA continues to reject the position that the non-substantive entry must be discarded as an

Page 224

Page 9

inadvertent “scrivener‘s errorﬂ," see Am. Petroleum, 714 F.3d at 1337, the agency is duty-bound
to adopt this alternative interpretation.

EPA’s refusal to advance or acknowledge this alternative is unsurprising, of course,
because under this approach the Proposed Rule would still be unlawful. Under this alternative
interpretation, EPA would be prohibited from using Section 111(d) both: (1) to require regulation
of any HAP listed in Section 112(b), regardless of whether the HAP is being emitted from a
source regulated under Section 112; and (2) to require regulation of (my pollutant emitted from a
source category that is regulated under Section 112, Even under this alternative reading, EPA
still cannot rely on Section 111(d) as a basis for the Proposed Rule because of the regulatory
scheme established under Section 112.[4]

EPA has fundamentally erred in relying upon the ﬂawed reasoning in the vacated 2005
rule to justify the Proposed Rule. It is simply unconscionable for EPA to go forward with this
massive and costly regulation based entirely upon what it has admitted to be a clerical “drafting
error." I urge you to withdraw the Proposed Rule immediately and avoid needless litigation.

Sincerely,

Patrick Morrisey
Attorney General of West Virginia

Re: EPA Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Existing Electric
Generating Units

Dear Administrator McCarthy:

The Attorneys General of seventeen states and the senior environmental regulator of an
eighteenth have followed with interest EPA’s statements regarding its intention to promulgate
guidelines for performance standards for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from existing electric
generating units (EGUs).

We recognize EPA’s obligation to promulgate these guidelines through an open and transparent
process, which would include input from all stakeholders As the statutory responsibility and
authority under Section 111(d) for developing and implementing performance standards is vested
at the state level, we intend to participate fully in this process as representatives for our States.

Enclosed with this letter is a white paper setting forth our position on both EPA and the states’
authority under Section 111(d). The white paper responds to EPA's aggressive proposal for
GHG performance standards for new 136 Us and indications of a similarly aggressive stance on
existing EGUS. Our concerns are justified given EPA'S unwillingness to appropriately defer to
State authority under the Clean Air Act in recent years.


Page 226

Ms. McCarthy
Page Two
Septamber 11, 2013

As the white paper describes, Section 111(d) is unambiguous in granting to states the sole
authority to determine actua1 substantive standards as applied to individual sources. EPA’s role
is limited to establishing procedures whereby states develop and implement performance
standards for existing EGUs. We trust EPA will to adhere to the limitations of its authority
under the Clean Air Act when adopting guidelines for the states' development of plans for GHG
performance standards for existing EGUS.

We appreciate your consideration of our position and restate our cpmmitment to cooperative
federalism as required under the CAA.

Sincerely,

Jon Bruning
Attorney General

Perspective of 18 States on Greenhouse Gas Emission Performance Standards
for Existing Sources under 1119(d) Clean Air Act;

Introduction

As State Attorneys General, we believe it is critical to bring public awareness to another example of what has unfortunately become routine: the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA" or "Agency") is poised to: yet again propose new regulations that venture well beyond the limits of the agency's authority. The President has called upon EPA to propose greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards, regulations, or guidelines for existing power plants by June 1, 2014 and to finalize those rules by June 2015. As this paper will show, EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act is limited to developing a procedure for states to establish emissions standards for. existing sources.: EPA, if unchecked, will continue to implement regulations which far exceed its statutory authority to the detriment of the States, in whom Congress has vested authority under the Clean Air Act, and whose citizenry and industries will ultimately pay the price of these costly and ineffective regulations

Last year, EPA published a proposed rule regulating carbon dioxide ("CO2") emissions from new electric utility generating units ("EGUs"), 77 Fed. Reg. 22,392 (April 13, 2012) (EGU NSPS). In light of recent comments from industry, EPA is considering the need to re propose this standard due to its failure to finalize the action within the CAA's 1 year timeframe In addition, on April. 15 and 17, 2013. some states and environmental groups filed 60- and 180 day Notices of Intent to sue EPA under section 3040a) of the Clean Air Act CAA") for failure to perform the allegedly non-discretionary duty of and/or unreasonably delaying finalizing the 

Page 228

EGU NSPS and proposing standards for existing EGUs.' In response to these Notices a coalition of Attorneys General has requested to be involved in any settlement discussions with advocates of broad federal GHG regulations.

EPA states that once it has issued regulations for an air pollutant from new sources in a particular source category under the CAA l li(b), it has legal authority to regulate emissions from existing sources of that air pollutant within the same source category.” The final version of the new source performance standards for new EGUs will likely face legal challenge. However the following analysis assumes the final EGUNSPs for GHG emissions is upheld and EPA moves forward with rulemaking for existing sources.

The purpose of this paper is to identify a timely example of a serious, ongoing problem in environmental regulation: the tendency of EPA to seek to expand the scope of its jurisdiction at the cost of relegating the role of the States to merely implementing whatever Washington prescribes, regardless of its wisdom, cost, or efficiency in light of local circumstances. The issue is not new. The States and EPA have been at odds over the scope of their respective responsibilities under the federal environmental statutes since the statutes' inception. The recent increase in the level of federal regulatory activity under the Clean Air Act has generated
increase: in the level of federal regulatory activity under the Clean Air Act has generated a

i a settlement agreement entered into by a number of states and environmental groups in December 2010 set forth deadlines for EPA to issue regulations with respect to GHG emissions from existing EGUs. See, 75 Fed. Reg 82.392 (Dec. 20, 2010). The deadlines have passed.

3 The authority of EPA to promulgate GHG NSPS for existing EGUs, even if it finalizes its proposed GHG NSPS rule for new EGUs, has been questioned, See William J. Hann, The Clean Air Act as an obstacle to the Environmental Protection Agency's Anticipated Attempt to Regulate Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Power Plants. THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY (Mar. 2013 available at p://www.fed-soc org publications de ncys anticipated attempt lo-regulate-greenhouse clean-air-act-as-an-obstacle-to-the-environmental protection-age gas emissions from existing power-plants. Without conceding that EPA does have authority to promulgate a GHG NSPS for existing EGUs. we assume for purposes of discussion here that EPA does have that authority and will exercise it.

Page 229

corresponding increase in concerns among the States regarding the preservation of their role in environmental protection. 

The way in which EPA has "pushed the envelope" in interpreting its legal authority under the CAA to promulgate a New Source Performance Standard for new ECUs portends. a similarly aggressive and unlawful approach to the regulation of existing EGUs. EPA's clear policy goal in establishing its new source standards is to prevent the construction. of new coal plants. EPA's proposed EGU NSPS would foreclose the construction of new coal-based electric generation absent carbon capture and storage ("CCS"), yet CCS is likely to remain commercially infeasible for a decade or more. The elimination of coal as a fuel for new electric generation would have highly concerning implications for electricity prices and for the economy and job-creation in general, as well as the competitiveness of American manufacturing. 

In order to justify its proposed standard that would not allow new coal-based EGUs absent CCS, EPA has taken unprecedented steps. The Agency proposed to combine coal and combined cycle natural-gas units into a single regulatory category, something it has never done before for coal and gas EGUs. Indeed, it did not even go so far as recently as last year when it proposed NSPS for traditional pollutants. emitted by EGUs. EPA's aggressive posture in its proposed new source NSPS, both as to foreclosing new coal plants and in pushing the scope of its claimed legal authority, raises serious questions as to the approach EPA will eventually take when it promulgates existing-source NSPS 

If EPA proceeds against existing coal plants with the same hostility, it is likely to be reversed in court. As this paper shows, EPA does not have authority to promulgate prescriptive limitations for existing coal-fueled EGUs. Under section III(d) of the CAA, EPA must recognize that States have broad discretion to determine the nature of NSPS requirements for 


Page 230

existing ECUS, EPA may require States to adopt standards, and EPA may guide how States do so procedurally, but the States are vested with the legal authority to decide the ultimate standards.

The Statutory and Regulatory. Framework For Developing Performance Standards For Existing Sources

The focus of the following analysis is the limitations Congress placed on EPA's authority under Section ill(d) of the CAA. Section ill (d) provides EPA with the authority to develop standards of performance for existing sources and directs the Agency to: 

prescribe relations, which shall establish a procedure similar to that provided by section 7410 of this title under which each State shall submit to the Administrator a plan. which establishes standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant.. to which a standard of performance under this section would apply if such existing source were a new source.

Section 111 (d) requires the existence of a performance standard for new sources as a condition precedent to the development of such standards for existing sources. Thus, the legality of the final version of EPAs EGU NSPS rule has significant implications for EPA's ability to require regulation of existing EGUs.

Most importantly, section 111(d) invokes the principle of cooperative federalism with roles clearly delineated for both EPA and the States. The reference to S l 10 refers to the general process by which States submit their State Implementation Plans SIPs for EPA review Accordingly, EPA's authority under S III (d) is limited to establishing, in the statute's term. a "procedure" by which the States submit plans for regulating existing sources. EPA cannot promulgate rules establishing the substantive standards to be imposed on existing sources. 

The cooperative federalism is illustrated by EPA's general procedural regulations relating to the States'. adoption and submittal of plans establishing standards. of performance for existing.

Page 231

sources. Those regulations require EPA to issue a "guideline document' concurrently with, or after, the "proposal of standards of performance for the control of a designated pollutant from affected facilities." 40 C.F.R. S 60.22(a). The content of the guideline document is of great importance to the preservation of the States role in the development of performance standards for existing sources.

Under EPA's regulations, the guideline document is to provide information for the development of State plans" including a "description of systems of emissions reduction which, in the judgment of the Administrator, have been adequately demonstrated." Id at (b)(2). The guideline document also shall contain an "emission guideline" providing "criteria for judging the adequacy" of S 111(d) plans. 40 C.F.R. S 60.22(b)(5); see, 40 Fed. Reg. 53,341 (Nov. 17, 1975). The emission guideline reflects the application of the best system of emission reduction (considering the cost of such reduction) that has been adequately demonstrated," 40 C.F.R. S 60.22(b)(5). The emission guideline must also allow sub-categorization "when costs of control. physical limitations, geographical location, or similar factors make lit appropriate." Id.

Also under EPA's regulations, the States have nine months. to submit a plan for the control of the designated pollutant to which the guideline document applies," 40 C.F.R. .S 60.23(a)( l). The plan shall include emission standards" that "shall prescribe allowable rates of emissions except when it is clearly impracticable." 40 C.F.R. S 60.24(a), (b)(l). The States have significant discretion in formulating these plans. Although the "emission standards" are to be no less stringent than the corresponding emission guideline(s), the States may make a case-by case determination that a specific facility or class of facilities should be subject to a less-stringent standard or longer compliance schedule due to I) cost of control: 2) physical limitation of installing necessary control. equipment; and 3) other factors making the less-stringent standard ”

Page 232

more reasonable. See, 40 C.F.R. S 60.24 (c), (D. EPA then has four months to determine whether the plan meets the requirements discussed above, If EPA disapproves the plan, the State may correct the deficiencies or, under EPA's construction, the Agency may issue its own plan within 6 months of the original submission deadline See, 10 C.FR. S 60.27(c), (d)

Although these regulations have never been tested in court, EPA undoubtedly has power to adopt procedural regulations governing State adoption of plans setting forth performance standards. But, importantly, and consistent with the statute, the determination of the actual substantive standards is left to the state

Existing Source Performance Standards for CO2 Emissions from EGUs

In contemplating regulation of existing EGUs, however, EPA appears poised to go beyond the establishment of procedures and usurp the states' authority by setting minimum substantive requirements for state performance standards. Having reviewed the statutory and regulatory requirements for developing standards of performance for existing sources. in a general sense, we now apply that legal framework to CO2 emissions from EGUs. Although EPA has not yet issued a proposed guideline document for Co2 emissions from existing EGUs. we offer general observations about potential issues that have already presented themselves

And EPA's guideline document and the emission guideline contained therein are to "reflect[] the application of the best system of emission reduction (considering the cost of such reduction) that has been adequately demonstrated 40 C.F.R. § 60.22(b)(5); see also, 42 U.S.C. S 74II(1) (definition of "standard of performance The crux of this requirement thus is that the system be, in fact, adequately demonstrated

It seems incontrovertible that no post-combustion reduction system has been "adequately demonstrated" for CO2 emissions from EGUs on a broad, commercial scale. A system of carbon capture and storage is perhaps a decade away from being technologically and economically feasible. A permitting system for storing CO2 emissions underground and set of legal rules governing liability for CO2 storage has not been put in place in most states. Without an adequately demonstrated post-combustion control technology, EPA must look to standards based on cost-effective efficiency improvements at electric generating units, because more efficient units will produce lower CO2 emissions per unit of heat input or electricity output 

EPA and others may believe that efficiency measures will not ensure the amount of CO2 emission reductions they desire. As a result. some groups have proposed EPA be given flexibility to develop emission guidelines based on trading programs with statewide emissions caps, increased reliance on lower CO2, emitting facilities, or demand-side. and non-regulated source reductions. In short, EPA may attempt to force coal-fueled EGUs to decrease operation time or retire early, or force utilities to rely more heavily on natural gas and other resources in an effort to ensure greater CO2 emission reductions. Such proposals, often offered as ways. of providing "flexibility," do not conform to the limitations Congress has placed on EPA in the 

Page 234

Clean Air Act, nor do they properly preserve the primary role of States in the development of standards of performance for existing sources. Under § lll (d) it is the States, not EPA, that are authorized to adopt performance standards: therefore it is the States, not EPA, that weigh the S li(a)(1) factors to determine what technology is adequately demonstrated. Simply put, EPA lacks statutory authority (and is limited by its own regulations) to issue emission guidelines seeking reductions of CO2 emissions from coal-based EGUs in a manner based on something other than an adequately demonstrated reduction system for such EGUs 

To the extent S 111(d) provides authority for flexible approaches to establishing performance standards to seek reductions in CO2 emissions, that authority is vested in States, not EPA. And of course, under l 16, States retain authority to adopt more stringent CO2 controls than EPA has the authority to mandate 

As noted, § I 111(d) specifies that EPA's regulatory authority is limited to developing a procedure for the submission of state plans. EPA's general regulations authorizing the issuance of emission guidelines that establish minimum requirements, depending on how EPA implements this guideline authority in a particular case, bear on substantive standard-setting But EPA does not have the authority to establish minimum substantive requirements 

EPA cannot dictate substantive outcomes. The agency can require that States actually adopt performance standards based on application of the § 111 (a)(l) factors 

States are additionally afforded the discretion to consider "among other factors, the remaining useful life of the existing source to which such standard applies" when developing performance standards for existing units. Beyond this. Silt(d) does not provide authority for EPA to reject a State plan if it does not contain a standard of performance as that term is defined, and based on the factors set forth, in § Il 1(a)(I)

In sum, the CAA imposes responsibility for air pollution control at the State and local levels because of the proximity to existing sources. and familiarity with local operating conditions. State implementation plans are thus the primary architecture of emission controls See. §§ 107(a); 110(a): 111(d). The "structure of the CAA militates against reading an extra- statutory requirement into the Act's limitations on state discretion, Because the states enjoy wide discretion' in implementing the Act, the imposition of newfound restrictions upsets the Act's careful. balance between state and federal authority, Union Elec.

Conclusion 

The prospect for EPA adoption of GHG performance standards for new or existing coal- based EGUs raises serious concerns. EPA's aggressive standards for new coal-based EGUs indicate a similarly aggressive approach to existing coal-based EGUs. While EPA is authorized to require States to submit plans containing performance standards, EPA may not dictate what those performance standards shall be. Nor may EPA require States to adopt GHG performance standards that are not based on adequately demonstrated technology or that mandate, in the guise of "flexible approaches." the retirement or reduced operation of still-viable coal-based EGUs. 

These concerns are serious. EPA regulations may harm the nascent economic recovery Moreover, our federalist system of government, as implicated in the CAA, requires that EPA

recognize the rights and prerogatives of States. The extent and form of greenhouse gas regulation is important to the States; it is critical that States be allowed to play their proper roles in making the significant policy judgments that are required in adopting any such regulation.

Senator SESSIONS. Thank you. 
The President, on November 14, 2012, said, ‘‘The temperature 
around the globe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 
years ago.’’ Then on May 29, 2013, he said, ‘‘We also know that the 
climate is warming faster than anybody anticipated five or 10 years 
ago.’‘ 
I want to ask each of our former Administrators if any of you 
agree that is an accurate statement on the climate? If you do, raise 
your hand. Thank you. The record will reflect no one raised their 
hands. 
One of the things Dr. Botkin mentioned was this is difficult when 
we have assertions repeated that are not established by the facts. 
The same is true about hurricanes. If you count the number of Cat-
egory 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 hurricanes each year, this is not a matter of 
dispute, we don’t have more. The IPCC acknowledges that. 
Yet we have the President and top officials repeating that as a 
justification to hammer the coal industry and driving up costs in 
our Country. 
Attorney General Strange, I had a question I wanted to ask of 
you. I appreciate your appearance and your fine leadership in the 
State. 
The four EPA Administrators today say we need to act now. 
Would you also say it is important that we act according to the law 
and do you believe EPA’s proposed existing power plan guidelines 
are consistent with the law? 
Mr. STRANGE. That really is why I am here, not to debate the 
science or the policy. That is a matter for the scientists and for the 
members of this committee and members of the U.S. Senate. 
My concern is whatever decision EPA makes and whatever policy 
it decides to implement that it follow the law. I think they failed 
to do that in this case. I appreciate your introducing for the record 
the letter from my colleague, Patrick Morrissey, the Attorney Gen-
eral of West Virginia which goes into great detail on the legal infir-
mities of this proposal as well as the letter from the 17 other AGs, 
bipartisan group of attorneys around the Country who feel the 
same way. 
Our role is to make sure that whatever the EPA comes up with 
that it follows the law, respects the State’s role in working to 
achieve the type of environmental regulation the Country decides 
it wants to have. That is the lane I am in, that is the oath I took 
and that is the reason I am here today. 
Senator SESSIONS. Our staff has done a study on the federalism 
aspects of EPA. The Clean Air Act establishes a cooperative fed-
eralism between States and EPA. Do you think the proposed exist-
ing power plan guidelines adhere to the Clean Air Act’s process? 
Mr. STRANGE. I do not think so, Senator. In a nutshell, I think 
what the EPA is attempting to do in this case is to regulate at the 
Federal level, removing almost all the discretion that would nor-
mally reside in the States. 
In my experience, maybe it was your experience as Attorney 
General when you preceded me, regulators like to regulate and it 
is an important role that we attorneys general play to ensure that 
when they decide to regulate, they stay within the bounds of their 
authority.

Oftentimes, if you are a regulator and see a problem or perceived 
problem, you want to regulate and at least in my experience, you 
naturally try to exert as much authority as you think is there and 
perhaps more. We think that is what is occurring in this case. 
That is why it is so important not only to me in Alabama but 
to attorneys general across the Country. 

Senator WHITESTONE. We will turn now to Senator Boxer for 
questions. Chairman Boxer, I should say in this room. 

Senator BOXER. Thank you so much. 
I am going to go rapid fire. 

Dr. Mason, when you talk you so remind me of the alarmist that 
we heard both in the 1970’s and the 1990’s over the Clean Air Act. 
Coming from a State that is undergoing a boom in clean energy 
jobs, I am here to say I am going to send you some of the stats 
that Hon. Christine Todd Whitman put out because I want to know 
if you think they are incorrect. 

From 1980 to 2012, the total emissions in the U.S. of six common 
air pollutants dropped by 67 percent, our population grew by 38 
percent, our energy consumption increased by 27 percent, and our 
GDP more than doubled. I checked and this is my statistic that 
jobs increased 88 percent. 

I am going to send that to you for your commentary because 
again, we have always heard this every time there is an initiative. 
It always turns out to be completely wrong. The alarmists are 
wrong. 

I also want to ask our four EPA folks to tell me if they agree 
with this. Senator Sessions and I have a disagreement. He is my 
friend and we respect each other. We have a disagreement on car-
bon. He says this is not a pollutant that hurts you but there is an 
endangerment finding. It was started under George W. Bush and 
completed under Barack Obama. 

Then there as a National Climate Assessment which was re-
quired by law every 4 years. Republicans voted for that 100–0 on 
February 6, 1990. This particular assessment calls out the dangers 
of carbon pollution and says it is going to increase ozone, increase 
asthma, increase hospital admissions, quoting directly, ‘‘Climate 
change is projected to harm human health by increasing ground 
level ozone.’’ 

They specifically cite more carbon pollution as increasing global 
temperatures, increasing premature deaths and worsened ozone 
particle pollution. 

Is there any one of the four of you who has a problem with that 
analysis? Let the record show they agree with that analysis. 
I want to talk to my friend from Alabama and ask you this ques-
tion. I have great respect for your office and your opinion but isn’t 
it true that Alabama lost all recent major Clean Air Act cases? 
Alabama lost its legal challenge to EPA’s CRUS, State air pollu-
tion rule in the Supreme Court. Alabama lost its legal challenge to 
EPA’s mercury and toxic air rule in the D.C. Circuit in the White 
Stallion case. Alabama lost its legal challenge to EPA’s 
endangerment finding and light duty vehicle GHG tailpipe stand-
ards in the case of Coalition for Responsible Regulation. Isn’t that 
a fact? 
240 

Mr. STRANGE. I do not doubt what you are saying, Senator. I do 
not recall. 

Senator BOXER. You do no recall losing those cases? 

Mr. STRANGE. I do and I think you are right, yes. 

Senator BOXER. I think that is important. 
Let me ask a question to Mr. Thomas. 

I know you have talked about the impacts in your home State 
of Florida that you are already seeing. I had the privilege of going 
in a helicopter over the Miami region. When you see how much 
water is there, it takes your breath away. 

I wonder if you could talk about how local communities in the 
State of Florida are joining together to address the growing im-
pacts of climate change. Do many of these local actions have bipar-
tisan support? 

Let me ask Mr. Thomas this. I only have 58 seconds left. 

Mr. THOMAS. Senator, particularly in the south Florida area, 
Miami area, six counties have basically come together specifically 
to work on adaptation measures dealing with the problems they 
are already facing. 

As I indicated, salt water intrusion, the drainage systems, how 
do they deal with today’s problem, an average sea level rise of 
about eight inches which has a significant impact. You are talking 
about areas that both because of their level above sea level but also 
because of the terrain and subsurface, basically the limestone and 
subsurface causes a significant issue in that part of the State. 
We see local governments struggling with the issue, spending 
significant amounts of money and my sense is that is going to be 
an expanding issue and an expanding problem, particularly in the 
south Florida area in the near term. 

I met with a group in the Miami area, including scientists who 
participated in the IPCC process. Their concern is what is hap-
pening today and how it will be exaggerated over the next 10 
years. They are not talking about long term, they are talking about 
10 years. 

Senator BOXER. Let me close by letting everyone know this. 
When it comes to environment, we have big differences. When it 
comes to preparing, we have come together and in the last WRDA 
bill, I wanted to mention that we have taken steps for our coastal 
States and also the Sacramento issue, Mr. Reilly, that you men-
tioned. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Senator Vitter. 

Mr. BOTKIN. May I may a scientific comment? 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. It is not in order. This is the time for Sen-
ators to ask questions. 

Senator Vitter, you are recognized. 

Senator VITTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

As I always am in these discussions, I am frustrated again, quite 
frankly at some of the cartoonist nature of the assertions, going 
after strawmen instead of having a detailed, serious discussion. I 
think Senator Boozman’s comment and explanation of the 97 per-
cent figure really goes to that. 

Ninety-seven percent believe in this consensus about climate 
change. However, it is defined so broadly that all or virtually all 
the Republican members of this committee would be among the 97 
241 

percent. I hope we can get beyond going after strawmen and hav-
ing these sorts of cartoonish conversations. 
With that theme of science, real science, real discipline in mind, 
let me start there. Of all of our panelists, who has graduate ad-
vanced degrees in the natural sciences? Dr. Botkin, let me ask you, 
in my opinion one of these areas with cartoonish claims and out-
landish claims is about severe weather multiplying every day. 
In fact, what is the historical record about the severity and fre-
quency overall of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts and floods? 

Mr. BOTKIN. As you had in past testimony from Roger Pielke, Jr., 
the analysis shows that these have not increased in terms of major 
storms. If that is the specific question, there has not been an in-
crease in tornadoes and major storms according to his analysis. 

Senator VITTER. I just point that out because that is one of the 
most common rallying cries about this cartoonish debate, severe 
weather. 

Also, let us talk about real science. We have here obviously a 
huge issue which is whatever we do, what is the rest of the world 
doing. These posters just illustrate what China is doing but there 
are other countries that are a major factor—India, Brazil and so 
forth. 

Dr. Botkin, with this in mind, will the EPA’s rule, as currently 
constructed, have a significant effect on global average tempera-
tures or sea level rise? 

Mr. BOTKIN. The scientific analyses show that if the United 
States acts alone, it will have a very insignificant effect but that 
does leave open whether this is supposed to be a leadership action 
or a scientific effective but in terms of the United States acting 
alone, it will have a very minor effect. 
Senator VITTER. Thank you. 

Mr. BOTKIN. May I make a comment about sea level rise? 
Senator VITTER. Go ahead but be very brief. My time is limited. 

Mr. BOTKIN. Most of the comments were about sea level rise. It 
is well known to geologists, oceanographers and glaciologists that 
the sea level has been rising since the end of the last ice age, 
12,500 years ago. The average estimated rate and measured rate 
has been a foot a century. That is natural background. 
It was mentioned specifically by one of the Senators was that it 
has risen ten inches in one place since 1930. Actually, that is with-
in that natural background. 

Senator VITTER. Doctor, I do not mean to cut you off but this is 
on my limited time. 

Mr. BOTKIN. I just wanted to say that is completely natural. 
Senator VITTER. Let us go on to the other big impact we can 
measure which is economic impact. Dr. Mason, this is not a theo-
retical discussion. Europe has basically been living this in the last 
ten plus years and is in the process of essentially reversing course. 
A headline from The New York Times reads ‘‘Europe Facing Eco-
nomic Pain May Ease Climate Rules’’; the Bloomberg News, ‘‘Coal 
Returns to German Utilities Replacing Low Cost Nuclear’’; the 
Guardian, ‘‘Soaring Energy and Housing Costs Force Poorest 
Homes to Turn to Food Banks’’; and the New York Times, ‘‘Renew-
able Energy in Spain Is Taking A Beating.’’ What should we ob-
serve and learn about that European experience? 
242 

Mr. MASON. I think you have to acknowledge that in terms of the 
treatment in this medical analogy, prior carbon policy has been the 
equivalent of medieval blood letting. It has not worked, it is not 
constraining emissions in world markets and there are two things 
you have to notice.
 
First of all, there is already a market developed not only to argue 
against taking action with respect to carbon; there is a market de-
veloped in setting up these financial trading desks that trade car-
bon, that wants to lobby to undertake this option. It is a very 
strong and very large industry right now. 
There are interest groups pushing for this as a solution that, in 
fact, will not work. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Senator Markey. 

Senator MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I want to go to the EPA Administrators. Thank you all so much 
for your service over the years. 
I have a chart here of U.S. GDP since the Great Depression in 
1929. President Johnson signed the first Clean Air Act into law in 
1963. It was amended in 1970, 1977 and 1990, as indicated on the 
chart. 

I would like a quick answer from each of you. Has GDP, Mr. 
Ruckelshaus, gone up or down since each of these Clean Air Act 
laws? 

Mr. RUCKELSHAUS. Senator, I am not going to argue with your 
chart. It has gone up. 
Senator MARKEY. Thank you. Governor? 

Ms. WHITMAN. I cannot disagree with that. That is a fact. 
Senator MARKEY. Thank you. 

Mr. REILLY. The Clean Air Act amendments we were responsible 
for in 1990 were followed by ten record setting years in GDP 
growth. 

Senator MARKEY. Interesting—not a blood letting then, is that 
what you are saying? 

Mr. REILLY. No, I would not say so. 
Senator MARKEY. You would not say that. Thank you. 

Mr. Thomas. 

Mr. THOMAS. I certainly agree with your chart, it has gone up. 
Senator MARKEY. Do you think that finding new facts of dealing 
with climate change can actually create jobs in our economy by 
unleashing innovation in the marketplace to accomplish that goal, 

Mr. Ruckelshaus? 

Mr. RUCKELSHAUS. There is no question. It will create jobs. It 
will also have some impact on existing employment. 

Ms. WHITMAN. I look on it as not only will it create new jobs in 
some of the renewable fields and fields we have not even talked 
about, but we have one industry already that is producing a lot of 
jobs and can produce a lot more. That is the nuclear energy indus-
try which is a base power which releases none of these greenhouse 
gases or other regulated pollutants while producing power. 

Mr. REILLY. The 1990 amendments created an enormous number 
of jobs both in natural gas and also in western clean coal. 

Mr. THOMAS. I think without question jobs will be created. On 
the other hand, I think it will impact jobs and I think we have a 

243 

responsibility to focus on how we provide assistance to those whose 
jobs are being impacted. 

Senator MARKEY. I would like to move to another example which 
is the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative across the northeast in 
terms of the impact that has had in reducing greenhouse gases and 
at the same time overlapping with an economy across the northeast 
which has continued to grow over those years. 

Since the RGGI was put in place, there has actually been a 40 
percent reduction in greenhouse gases in those States on average 
where it was put in place but in addition, it has helped to save con-
sumers money, created jobs, generated over $750 million in eco-
nomic value in the State of Massachusetts alone from 2009 to 2013. 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit all of that economic data 
for the record. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Without objection. 
[The referenced information follows:]

Economic Benefits of RGGI
June 2013

RGGI at a Glance:
* 9 States (MD, DE, NY, CT, RI, MA, VT, NH & ME)
* Applies to CO2 emitting power plants over 25 MW
* Went into effect Jan 1. 2009
* At quarterly auctions power plants purchase allowances to
cover emissions.
* Revenue reinvested according to state plans
* Reforms to cap level-and other changes take effect in 2014

States participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative 
(RGGI) have gained significant benefits from the program to date, 
and far greater benefits will be realized by implementing recently 
agreed reforms. 

Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants in the region have
dropped significantly since RGGI was formed. Meanwhile. revenue
from auctions of allowances (permits to emit C02) has been 
invested in energy efficiency and other consumer programs that 
reduce energy costs while increasing economic output and 
employment. RGGl—funded energy efficiency programs reduce 
expenditures for fossil fuels imported to generate power, thus
making states more competitive while reducing carbon emissions.
RGGI states have agreed to program improvements based on the
first four years of operation — most importantly the allowance budget (the “cap”) is being reduced to
account for long-lasting changes in the electricity sector that have brought emissions to historic lows[i]
Implementing these reforms and investing additional RGGI revenue in clean energy and other consumer
programs will benefit participating states significantly.

Benefits To-Date

Tracking RGGI dollars through state reinvestment programs makes it possible to calculate RGGI’S
impact on member states" economies to—date, taking into account direct effects of projects funded by
RGGI, as well as broader impacts from wages and efficiency savings boos ting consumer spending
throughout the economy. Through June 2013 sales of allowances have generated $1.4 billion in revenue,
which has been reinvested in energy efficiency and other programs that add $24 billion in net value to
participating states’ economies over 10 years. This increase in growth generates over 23,000 job years of
employment across the economy (each job year represents one full time job for 1 year). [ii]

Benefits from a Strengthened RGGI

In order to account for the significant and enduring decline in C02 emissions since RGGl began, RGGI
states agreed to reduce the oversupply of allowances and reset the cap at current emissions levels (91
million tons). If states continue to invest additional revenue from RGGI according to existing
plans, through 2020 RGGI could generate an additional $3.2 billion in funding and add over $8
billion in net value and 57,000 job years of employment to state economics.[iii]

<See original for figure: Improved RGGI - Additional Benefits 2013-2020>

*New Jersey ceased participation in RGGI and received no funding after 2011

Page 245

The Role of Energy Efficiency

The majority of auction proceeds across the region are used to support energy efficiency programs.
which directly benefit consumers in a number of ways:

* First, reduced energy consumption due to efficiency improvements brings down monthly electric
bills for participating consumers.

* Second, reduced consumption decreases wholesale electricity prices, delivering additional savings
to all consumers

* Third. reduced demand for electricity brings down emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants,
decreasing the demand for allowances and the overall cost of reducing emissions.

Efficiency investments also create the highest level of economy- wide benefits by creating local
efficiency-related jobs, by reducing expenditures on imported fossil fuels, and by boosting consumer
spending on other goods and services. Direct employment benefits of efficiency programs range from
energy service contractors who install insulation and efficient equipment to manufacturers of advanced
energy saving technologies. Indirect employment benefits accrue across the economy as the money
customers save on monthly energy bills is spent locally, benefitting everyone from bus drivers to bus
boys. In New England states every $1 spent on electric energy efficiency improvements creates $4.30 to
$6.40 in economic activity.“ While all states accrue net benefits from participation in RGGI, states
investing greater proportions of auction proceeds in efficiency derive the greatest benefits.

Notes:

Notes: Recent analysis of RGG emissions trends and drivers by ENIZ finds that fuel-switching, non-emitting generation and efficiency investments have caused emissions to fall ~35% to 45% below the cap since the program began in 2009, and these trends show no sign of reversing.

Senator MARKEY. Governor Whitman, maybe you could talk 
about that issue, about the job creation aspect of this, especially 
since it seems to be a core argument here using medieval blood let-
ting terms to describe what the impact is since the States in the 
RGGI have actually seen economic growth. 

Ms. WHITMAN. I think it is absolutely fair to say that obviously 
there are going to be jobs that will be impacted with whatever ac-
tions we take. That has always been true. When we have an obliga-
tion to ensure that we do the best we can for those who will be im-
pacted and find other ways of earning a living and recognize that 
this is real and people will get hurt. 

One of the things you learn as a Governor, as anybody in a posi-
tion where you have to make decisions, is you cannot make a deci-
sion that has an equal impact on everyone. Some people will not 
see the same benefits as others and may see a down turn. It is your 
obligation to do what is in the best interest of the greatest number 
and do everything you can to mitigate the down side for those who 
will be negatively impacted. 

I think we have seen that time and again. We have been able 
to do that in this Country and been able to increase jobs. 

Senator MARKEY. Mr. Thomas, Dr. Botkin has argued for more 
direct observations of climate variables. You mentioned both sea 
level rise and an increase in heavy rainfall in your testimony. Sea 
level rise and rainfall have been measured by scientists for dec-
ades. They are not theoretical or models. 
What are the impacts of those directly observed changes on your 
own home State, Mr. Thomas? 

Mr. BOTKIN. Excuse me, Senator. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Could you please allow Mr. Thomas to an-
swer the question he has been asked? 

Mr. THOMAS. Senator, as I indicated to Senator Boxer, clearly 
south Florida particularly is dealing today with sea level rise as it 
impacts both saltwater intrusion on our coastal areas, impacts our 
drinking water, draining systems that are critical to the overall 
well being of many of the coastal communities in south Florida. 
Today’s sea level rise is indeed an issue in our State just as it 
is in a number of other States. 

Senator MARKEY. I am the son of a milkman so I know that tech-
nological change can occur. The invention of refrigerators actually 
made obsolete delivery of milk each morning. It does not mean 
there were more milkmen that were created; it meant there was an 
absence of jobs that were created to revolutionize the way in which 
that industry operated. We have seen that from the beginning of 
time and we have to embrace it here. The job creation is obvious. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Senator Inhofe. 
Senator INHOFE. That is pretty good. I enjoyed that. 
First of all, let me mention that we keep talking about the Clean 
Air Act amendments of 1990. I want everyone to know not only did 
I vote for them, but I was an original co-sponsor of those. 
They worked. That was dealing with real pollutants—SOx and 
NOx. It was never meant to deal with CO2. I think we all under-
stand that. The successes were there. You could actually use that 
as an argument against going into regulating something that most

of us do not believe is a pollutant, but we will not make that argu-
ment. 

I think Senator Boozman has pretty much defused the 97 per-
cent. We are going to hear it over and over again but he has pretty 
well answered that. 

I had a question for the three of you but I am going to skip you, 
Attorney General Strange, because Jeff already asked the question. 
I have to say this, that Scott Pruitt holds you in the highest regard 
among all the attorneys general in the United States. 
Dr. Botkin, you are the only scientist on this panel. I would like 
to ask you this. I happened to be in Copenhagen when this whole 
thing broke. Everything was predicated on the assumption that 
IPCC was going to be accurate—they were the ones who started 
this whole thing. 

I was there when Climate Gate broke. We all remember that is 
where they uncovered the IPCC had manipulated reports, covered 
up errors and made their global warming case stronger than it 
was. 

The way that was kind of covered up in our media here, we have 
kind of an alarmist bias in our media here but throughout the 
world, it was not. The UK Telegraph I think is the largest printed 
publication in the UK. It says, ‘‘The Worse Scientific Scandal of 
Our Generation.’’ The Financial Times said, ‘‘The Stink of Intellec-
tual Corruption Is Overpowering.’’ The Guardian said, ‘‘It Is No 
Use Pretending That This Isn’t A Major Blow.’’ 
I ask you as a scientist, why do you think there are people who 
still believe that this science was generated? The reason I am ask-
ing this question is because if you go back and look at my website 
in 2002, you will see I listed not a few but hundreds of scientists 
who disagreed with the IPCC. Your comments on that? 

Mr. BOTKIN. Senator, I have asked myself this question many 
times because what I do is look at the facts and check all the facts. 
I found that the IPCC reports are not consistent and are biased. 
Are you asking me why do so many people believe that? 

Senator INHOFE. That is good. 

Mr. BOTKIN. I have puzzled about that a great deal. I can say 
that one of my favorite books is by Charles McCabe published in 
1841. 

Senator INHOFE. We are running out of time. 

Mr. BOTKIN. I do not think there is a scientific answer to why 
so many people have come to believe this. It has become a popular 
issue. All I try to do is look at the facts. I have worked very hard 
to try to determine the effects of this over my career and I feel this 
data has changed and that it is less of an effect and danger than 
we thought before. I am surprised and shocked. 

Senator VITTER. Dr. Mason, you being the only economist on this 
panel, let me ask you a question. 

Years ago when this first started, a lot of us believed it was true 
because that was what was supposed to be believed. It happened 
at that time that I chaired this committee. When I found out they 
were talking about what the cost would be, if you remember the 
Wharton Econometric Survey came out, the MIT came out, Charles 
Rivers came out, and all came to the same conclusion on the cost

of this. We were talking about the cost of cap and trade would be 
between $300-$400 billion a year. 
First, I would ask if you agreed with that analysis with them at 
that time? 

Mr. MASON. I have not run the job losses particularly, but I 
would not be surprised at all by that. 

Senator INHOFE. That is the one thing that is pretty consistent. 
We have not had a lot of people disagree with that. My question 
would be this. These bills we are talking about, the first was the 
McCain-Lieberman bill in 2003, then in 2005, the same thing, the 
Warner-Lieberman and it went on up to Senator Markey, when he 
was in the House, had a bill, all of them were talking about regu-
lating the emissions of entities that emitted 25,000 tons or more. 
The Clean Air Act regulates 250 tons or more. 

I would ask you as an economist, if it is true that it would be 
between $300-$400 billion a year for the 25,000 tons or more, do 
you have any idea what it would cost the American people if they 
were able to successfully regulate this under the Clean Air Act? 
Mr. MASON. Orders of magnitude more. 

Senator INHOFE. That is a good answer. 
Thank you very much. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Senator Boozman? 

Senator BOOZMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Professor Mason, in your testimony, you address disparitive goals 
across States. Arkansas is one of the most difficult targets in the 
Country. You said there will be State level impacts that affect jobs 
and growth. Would you explain how these impacts can impact op-
portunities in States like Arkansas and what that will mean for 
consumers? 

Mr. MASON. Very simply, to the extent that consumers in these 
States derive energy from plants in those States, again, those con-
sumers will pay more for their electricity. This is where things get 
wonky because you will have cross State effects. 
Will Arkansas be able to, for instance, buy emissions from other 
States to satisfy their emissions? How are we going to control that? 
What can they buy? Can they buy permits or offsets internationally 
from Hungary which defrauded investors leading to this market 
shutdown I cited or other Third World countries that have been 
known not to even bother to check validity of the permits they are 
selling on markets leading to this fraud and international prob-
lems? 

We need to deal with these details. Until we actually sit down 
and look at these and look at the job losses that are very real— 
the Fed does this at every meeting when they talk about raising 
rates. They look at job losses and look at economic output. 
I think that we need to look at this with each and every increase 
in energy cost. Just waving your hands and saying, that will be 
fine, is another story because we are getting to a level of policy im-
plementation that is orders of magnitude greater than anything we 
have done before. 

To me from my perspective on financial crises, they arise in part 
because of problems in the market but also scale and magnitude 
relative to the economic system. We have had lots of little mini 
securitization crises since 1990. None affected the economy until

we had it happen with mortgages, a big enough product to throw 
us into recession. 
We can do this and we can put the economy at risk but I think 
we need to think about this real hard before just diving in. This 
is different. 

Senator BOOZMAN. That is why we have a Congress and congres-
sional hearings, to go through all that theoretically and make sure 
we do it not in haste but get all the intended consequences out on 
the table. 

You mentioned it is like gravity that in order to make something 
not be used, you have to raise the price or that is a method of doing 
it. You mentioned the $30 figure. What would that do to the cost 
of utilities? 

Mr. MASON. RGGI right now is at about $5, California is at about 
$11. It is interesting and those might not have pushed back eco-
nomic growth but they are not pricing carbon either. They are just 
adding to the cost of energy with no upside benefit in terms of car-
bon. 

Thirty dollars is definitely going to raise prices further. We have 
seen 45 percent in the northeast cited today. I would expect prices 
would go up by orders of magnitude greater than that. 
Let me just say that there has been a lot of talk today about 
leadership in terms of carbon policy. Leadership is not just grab-
bing this failed system out of the EU or this ineffective system out 
of RGGI or California and plopping it down nationwide. 
Leadership is really thinking more deeply about the implementa-
tion of carbon policy and coming up with something better than the 
rest of the world has put together so far, implementing it and then 
having the rest of the world follow. 

That is why I cited the National Monetary Commission with re-
spect to the Federal Reserve. We did that. We have the best central 
bank in the world. Like or hate the details of it, we still lead in 
that throughout the world. I think we owe to our citizens to put 
together a very thoughtful approach, to put together a meaningful 
approach to carbon that can actually help the world while also pric-
ing an economic externality that is very real. 

Senator BOOZMAN. Thank you very much. 

Dr. Botkin, you would be one of the 97 percent that is talked 
about and certainly you feel like man is contributing and this and 
that but certainly you are not one that feels like the models are 
acceptable. I suspect you have many of your cohorts in the same 
camp. 

Mr. BOTKIN. I think the key thing here is that science is not a 
rule by majority method. That is the important thing. It is dis-
covery. 

I would like to quote Jonas Saulk, the inventor of the polio vac-
cine. He said, ‘‘I get into dialog with nature and put the question 
to nature, not to my colleagues because that is from whence the an-
swer must come.’‘ That is what I do. I always look at the data. 
Also, Richard Feynman, one of the great 20th Century physicists, 
said ‘‘Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.’‘ To keep say-
ing it is a majority is not a scientific statement and is not correct. 
I have spent 50 years working on climate change in a very con-
structive way. What I can tell you is that since about 1990, the

250 

data has started to move in the other direction away from an im-
portant effect by human beings. That is just what the facts show. 
Senator BOOZMAN. Thank you very much. 
My concern is certainly we need to examine the increased risk 
of this, but I can tell you there is tremendous increased risk for the 
men and women sitting back there and the hard working people of 
Arkansas if we are talking about a 45 percent or much greater 
probably in our case increase in utility prices. 
As far as jobs, we talk a lot about income disparity in this Coun-
try, what does that do to working moms, single moms and what 
does that do to people on fixed incomes? 
Again, thank you, Mr. Chair. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. Thank you very much, Senator Boozman. 
That will conclude the questioning. Let me just say some final 
thanks to our witnesses who are here. I appreciate particularly the 
efforts of the former Administrators. I would ask if Mr. Reilly and 
Mr. Thomas would answer my question for the record. 
The record will be kept open for an additional 2 weeks for anyone 
who wishes to add material to the record. 

I will ask unanimous consent to put in a review of the investiga-
tions that were prompted by what is called Climate Gate but I con-
tend is more accurately called Climate Gate Gape. In my view, the 
scandal was a phony scandal that was whipped up at the expense 
of a lot of scientific work that was then reviewed I think by six dif-
ferent authorities, including American investigators, independent 
investigators, university investigators and British investigators, 
every one of which gave a full clean bill of health to the science. 
I think that needs to be a part of the record if members are going 
to bring up so-called Climate Gate. 

[The referenced information was not receive at time of print.] 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. There has been some reference to the pro-
jections by the Chamber of Commerce as to what this proposed 
EPA regulation might cost. Some of our colleagues have leapt to 
cite that report but I think it is important for the hearing that we 
also include the Washington Post analysis of their claims which 
earned four Pinocchio’s. 

Depending on how far you get from the truth, you get more 
Pinocchio’s relating back to the story of Pinocchio, the wooden doll, 
whose nose would grow when he was not being truthful. I will in-
clude the Washington Post four Pinocchio finding about that. 
There is also an organization named PolitiFact which analyzes 
claims made, the political debate and tries to do a very neutral 
analysis of their accuracy. PolitiFact ruled a false for that report. 
I think in the interest of fairness, those should be admitted. 
I will ask unanimous consent that those two documents be ad-
mitted. 

[The referenced information was not receive at time of print.] 
Senator SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. Senator Sessions. 
Senator SESSIONS. Just to wrap up, I thank the panel for your 
testimony. This is an important issue. I believe Dr. Botkin is cor-
rect in saying that actual empirical data is not confirming the pro-
jections we have seen so far and a host of other areas. I will be sub-
mitting some documents to that effect. 


251 

I think it is appropriate for Congress to ask questions. Also, I 
would just say it is unacceptable that scientists like Dr. Botkin and 
others are being adversely treated as a result of their statements 
and scientific research that sometimes contradicts the powers that 
be. 
Thank you. 

Senator WHITEHOUSE. You are very welcome. It is always a 
pleasure to work with my Ranking Member. However much we 
may disagree on things, he is a very courteous colleague and we 
always work well together. 
I think this was not a hearing on the science. It was a hearing 
with the experience of previous Administrators. If we were to do a 
hearing on the science, then I think we would be adding scientists 
from NOAA, NASA, and the scientists who back our United States 
defense establishment and a great establishment of scientists, 
every major scientific organization in the Country. 
Perhaps Dr. Botkin is right and they are all wrong but I am not 
sure that would be the prudent course for our Country. 
Thank you all very much. 
We are adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 12:29 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

ABOUT THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY

The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is an organization of 40,000 lawyers,
law students, scholars and other individuals located in every state and law school in the nation
who are interested in the current state of the legal order. The Federalist Society takes no
position on particular legal or public policy questions, but is founded on the principles that
the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to
our constitution and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what
the law is, not what it should be.

The Federalist Society takes seriously its responsibility as a non—partisan institution engaged
in fostering a serious dialogue about legal issues in the public square. We occasionally produce
“white papers” on timely and contentious issues in the legal or public policy world, in an effort
to widen understanding of the facts and principles involved and to continue that dialogue.

Positions taken on specific issues in publications, however, are those of the author. and not
reflective of an organization stance. This paper presents a number of important issues, and
is part of an ongoing conversation. We invite readers to share their responses, thoughts, and
criticisms by writing to us at info@fedesoc.org, and, if requested, we will consider posting
or airing those perspectives as well. To that end, we offer links below presenting different
perspectives on this issue.

The Clean Air Act as an Obstacle to the Environmental Protection Agency’s Anticipated Attempt to Regulate Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Power PlantsWilliam J. HaunExecutive SummaryFor roughly two decades, the U.S. Congress has possessed a bipartisan consensus on the regulation of greenhouse gases from industrial sources: It is best to let sleeping dogs lie.[1] Both Democrats and Republicans cited a variety of practical problems that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA” or the “Agency”) from using the Clean Air Act (“CAA”)—the awkward basis for current greenhouse gas regulation—to regulate emissions from existing “stationary sources” of energy.[2] Nevertheless, President Obama maintains that “America cannot resist this transition,”[3] and the EPA is thus expected to take a step that many believe has not merely prudential, but also legal, problems: to reinterpret Section 111(d), a provision of the CAA previously limited to existing-source emissions of discrete and relatively rare substances, to reach ubiquitous greenhouse gases.[4] Since the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, the EPA has begun regulating greenhouse gases under various provisions in the Act, including by prescribing fuel-efficiency standards for motor vehicles and by requiring control technology for greenhouse gas emissions in some preconstruction permits. Outside environmental groups took advantage of the new uncertainty in how far the EPA could go in regulating greenhouse gases by suing the Agency in 2008. The EPA settled the case in 2010, promising regulation different from past actions: mandating emission reductions from existing stationary sources of greenhouse gases,[5] the very subject that has bedeviled Congress for years. Without any new authority from Congress, the EPA is undertaking this new regulatory mission. The EPA, for its part, denies that its interpretation is a stretch, asserting in a 2008 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPR”) that cap-and-trade is a permissible form of 111(d) regulation.[6] However, there are very strong arguments that the EPA’s current interpretation of Section 111(d) is at odds with the controlling statutory language and dilutes that language to fit the Agency’s regulatory aims.[7] The EPA’s approach here, on this view, amounts not simply to circumventing the democratic process, but a depreciation of the practical problems this new regulation will pose—problems that the democratic process could address. In the 2008 ANPR, the Department of Energy (among others) noted the “burdensome and intrusive regulatory mechanism unlike any seen before” in the EPA’s likely course.[8] The potential breadth of the EPA’s efforts may require it to re-construe Section 111(d) to avoid issuing permits and ensuring compliance for all sizes of “stationary sources,” which it has already had to do in its Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permit program.[9] 1. Since the Clean Air Act’s 1990 amendments, the U.S. Congress abandoned a variety of attempts to address greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions through new legislation. They include, but are by no means limited to, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, America’s Climate Security Act of 2007, and the 2003 and 2005 Climate Stewardship Acts.2. For instance, Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) has warned that using the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions could result in a “glorious mess.” See Chris Holly, Dingell: EPA Climate Regulation Would Lead To ‘Glorious Mess,’ The Energy Daily (IHS), Apr. 11, 2008, available at http://www.theenergydaily.com/coal/Dingell-EPA-Climate-Regulation-Would-Lead-To-Glorious-Mess_672.html; see also George F. Allen & Marlo Lewis, Finding the Proper Forum for Regulation of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The Legal and Economic Implications of Massachusetts v. EPA, 44 U. Rich. L. Rev. 919, 920 (2010) (arguing “that for economic, legal, and prudential reasons, the CAA is an unsuitable instrument for addressing [greenhouse gas] emissions in the United States”).3. Inaugural Address by President Barack Obama, Jan. 21, 2013, available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/21/inaugural-address-president-barack-obama.4. See 77 Fed. Reg. at 22,421-27 (repeatedly announcing EPA’s intention to promulgate existing-source greenhouse gas standards under 111(d) “at the appropriate time”).5.

See Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. 31,514 (June 3, 2010). The rule sets emissions thresholds for regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA retains these thresholds (and, in some ways, supplements their measurements) so as to hone in on the largest greenhouse gas emitters. See 77 Fed. Reg.

While the Obama Administration has not yet proposed standards for existing power plants, such a move is expected within the year. With the prospect of imminent action, and growing political pressure to coerce unwilling states into unprecedented greenhouse gas regulation,10 whether the EPA has the authority to take these actions must be explored.This paper concludes that it does not: In amending Section 111(d) in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Congress unambiguously provided that the subsection could not be used to set standards for industries that are also regulated under the Clean Air Act’s Section 112 air toxics program. Because existing power plants have been regulated under that program since the 2012 Utility maximum achievable control technology (“MACT”) Rule,11 the EPA may not lawfully regulate them under Section 111(d). The EPA has disputed this limitation since 2005, when it sought to use cap-and-trade to regulate mercury emissions.12 Some legal commentators have argued that cap-and-trade is within the province of EPA’s regulatory authority.13 But they do not address whether Congress actually delegated to the EPA authority to construe Section 111(d) to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of existing stationary sources. While the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the EPA’s reformulation of power plant regulation on procedural grounds, it did not address the problems posed by the EPA’s interpretation of Section 111(d).14This paper will explore the EPA’s anticipated efforts to interpret its own authority to reach the goal of regulating of greenhouse gas emissions from existing stationary sources. This initiative raises serious questions of statutory interpretation, practical implementation, and the legitimacy of an administrative agency taking action without delegated authority from Congress. At the outset, a brief history of the EPA’s efforts to regulate greenhouse gas, and an outline of what cap-and-trade regulation would look like under Section 111(d), are required to grasp how the statute works.I. A Brief History of the Clean Air Act and Greenhouse Gas RegulationA. Greenhouse Gas Regulation Before Massachusetts v. EPAThe Clean Air Act Amendments of 197015 essentially established the modern Clean Air Act. The 1970 Amendments built on 1950s and 1960s legislation addressing air pollution, but expanded the 
——————————
41,051 (July 12, 2012). Nevertheless, expanding the targetable sources of greenhouse gas emitters raises similar questions of how far the EPA could credibly tailor its permitting and still see meaningful greenhouse gas reduction—especially if such tailoring is informed by prioritizing administration and compliance costs over greenhouse gas reduction. Cf. supra note 8.10 See, e.g., Daniel A. Lashof, Starla Yeh, David Doniger, Sheryl Carter & Laurie Johnson, Closing the Power Plant Carbon Pollution Loophole: Smart Ways the Clean Air Act Can Clean Up America’s Biggest Climate Polluters, Natural Res. Def. Council (Dec. 2012), available at http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/files/pollution-standards-report.pdf. 11 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units, 77 Fed. Reg. 9,304 (Feb. 16, 2012).12 On March 15, 2005, the EPA issued the “Clean Air Mercury Rule” that provided for the capping and reduction of mercury emissions from coal-powered plants. As mercury was listed as a “hazardous air pollutant” (“HAP”) under Section 112 of the Act, the EPA needed to delist mercury from Section 112 to reach it under Section 111(d), as discussed infra. See also Final Brief of Respondent Envtl. Prot. Agency, New Jersey v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574, 583 (D.C. Cir. 2008), 2007 WL 3231264, at *101-02 (explaining that the 1990 CAA amendments provide language prohibiting a Section 112 HAP from being regulated under Section 111(d) as an existing source). This delisting, vacated on procedural grounds, 517 F.3d at 583, allowed the EPA to fashion a construction of 111(d)’s language that would permit cap-and-trade regulation of existing stationary sources—a position the EPA still maintains. See supra note 6; see also 73 Fed. Reg. at 44,495 n.253 (noting that “many sources may be subject to standards under both section 111 and 112; however these standards establish requirements for the control of different pollutants.”). This is the EPA’s current interpretation, though as discussed infra it must be an incorrect construction because it dilutes the effect of the U.S. Senate’s amended language and renders the House’s language a nullity.13 See, e.g., M. Rhead Enion, Using Section 111 of the Clean Air Act for Cap-and-Trade of Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Obstacles and Solutions, 30 UCLA J. Envtl.

scope of federal authority in this area to such an extent that they are recognized as the true beginning of the modern regime.The starting point for understanding the Clean Air Act is the principle of cooperative federalism.16 The Act “establishes a partnership between EPA and the states for the attainment and maintenance of national air quality goals.”17 “[A]ir pollution prevention . . . and air pollution control at its source is the primary responsibility of States and local governments[.]”18 Stationary sources—for example, power plants—are therefore primarily regulated through state-specific implementation of general federal guidelines, formulated and implemented by the states, with the EPA playing an oversight role after its promulgation of initial guidelines. By contrast, mobile sources—“planes, trains, and automobiles”—are subject to more direct federal regulation, for example in the form of fuel quality standards.The Clean Air Act accordingly divides national policy into two primary titles: Title I for control of stationary sources of pollution,19 and Title II for control of mobile sources of pollution.20 The fundamental control program in Title I of the Act is the national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) program, which sets air quality standards at the level “requisite to protect the public health.”21 Because every stationary source of air pollution is local, and decisions about what sources are economically and environmentally desirable implicate state and local concerns, the NAAQS are primarily implemented through state implementation plans. In this regard, Congress “carefully balanced State and national interests by providing for a fair and open process in which State and local governments and the people they represent will be free to carry out the reasoned weighing of environmental and economic goals and needs.”22Title I of the Act also includes several other major regulatory programs for stationary sources. For the control of hazardous air pollutants (“HAPs”), Section 112 of the Act provides for the establishment of National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPs”).23 Section 112 mandates that the EPA regulate most, but not all, emitters of 189 listed hazardous air pollutants.24Additionally, Title I provides for New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) in Section 111. These NSPS regulate emissions from newly constructed or substantially modified stationary sources without reference to existing local air quality.25 Although the bulk of Section 111 concerns emissions standards for new sources, subsection 111(d) provides the EPA with authority to set standards for certain categories of existing sources. This authority is subject, however, to significant limitations, the details of which are addressed in the bulk of this paper.B. Massachusetts v.

final rule setting performance standards for the emission of certain substances from existing power plants.26 Greenhouse gases were not among them.27 A coalition of petitioners—comprised of three environmental groups (the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and the Environmental Defense Fund), eleven states (NY, CA, CT, DE, MA, ME, NM, OR, RI, VT, WA), the District of Columbia, and the City of New York—challenged the EPA’s rulemaking on several grounds in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.28 One of their complaints was the argument that the Clean Air Act obligated the EPA to set standards for greenhouse gas emissions.In September 2006, the portions of the challenge relating to greenhouse gas emissions were severed from the other challenges and held in abeyance pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA.29 The Court held in 2007 that greenhouse gases fit within the Act’s expansive definition of “air pollutant.”30 Although the opinion directly concerns the emission of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles under Title II, since 2007 Massachusetts has “spurred a cascading series of greenhouse gas-related rules and regulations,”31 most notably in the Act’s preconstruction permitting program for major stationary sources, such as many power plants and factories. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, the D.C. Circuit remanded the power plant challenge to the EPA for further proceedings.Rather than set its own regulatory agenda, the EPA chose to settle. In December 2010, the EPA entered into a settlement agreement that required it to set standards for greenhouse gas emissions under 111(b) for new and modified power plants and 111(d) 
for existing power plants by July 26, 2011. It further undertook to establish final rules following public comment, first for new and then for existing plants, by May 26, 2012.32 The settlement agreement itself announces that the EPA has initially determined “that there are cost-effective control strategies for reducing” greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and that “it would be appropriate for it to concurrently propose performance standards for [greenhouse gas] emissions from new and modified [plants] under [Clean Air Act] section 111(b) . . . and . . . from existing [plants] pursuant to [Clean Air Act] section 111(d)[.]” Unlike other regulatory actions, this settlement agreement was not subject to public notice or comment, and there is therefore no record showing that the Agency’s leadership seriously analyzed its legal authority to carry out the settlement. In these respects and others, the settlement appears to be a typical example of “sue and settle” regulation, under which the EPA settles actions—often under a consent decree but sometimes, as in this case, by voluntary settlement without judicial approval—in a way that binds it to significant regulatory commitments without appropriate input from Congress, other federal agencies, and other stakeholders.33 Resources for the—————————————26 71 Fed.

The Use of “Performance Standards” to Regulate Greenhouse Gas EmissionsThe EPA’s prior attempt to regulate mercury emissions through cap-and-trade highlights how Section 111(d) would theoretically handle a cap-and-trade scheme.35 Yet Section 111(d)’s characteristics also reveal the scheme’s fatal flaws in the context of greenhouse gases and existing stationary sources.Section 111(d) does not provide for cap-and-trade explicitly, but the EPA would likely consider it a “system of emission reduction,” an open-ended term within Section 111.36 Under Section 111(d), a state would theoretically implement cap-and-trade as part of its “standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant” that other CAA sections do not classify as criteria pollutants or HAPs.37The Clean Air Act is an awkward tool with which to regulate greenhouse gases. The greenhouse gas of primary concern is carbon dioxide, which is not an exotic compound produced in a few industrial processes, but is inevitably produced by the combustion of coal, gas or any other fossil fuel. The EPA has (correctly) refrained from suggesting that greenhouse gases38 are 
criteria pollutants subject to the NAAQS regime, or classifying them as hazardous air pollutants subject to the NESHAP regime. In light of the December 2010 settlement, it seems unlikely that the EPA will attempt to fit the square peg of greenhouse gases into the Act’s round holes through any other means than “performance standards” under Section 111.39 
of the Act. Part II of this paper explains why this assertion is incorrect.II. Section 111(d) Does Not Authorize Performance Standards for Existing Power PlantsWhile the EPA asserted in a 2008 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that cap-and-trade is a permissible form of 111(d) regulation,41 it will likely rely on its December 2010 settlement as the impetus for any new rules in this regard. Reliance upon the settlement, from the EPA’s perspective, affords it the path of least resistance—the EPA will argue that it is

legally bound to carry out its settlement bargain, lest a court order force it to do so, and is thus immune from “political” concerns over cap-and-trade. Yet this would leave important statutory and separation of powers questions unaddressed.The EPA’s 2010 settlement committed the Agency to rulemaking on a matter that the Congress has repeatedly (and explicitly) failed to address: regulating greenhouse gas emissions from existing stationary energy sources. The EPA cannot bargain with authority it never possessed. It cannot commit itself to doing something it has no power to do. In short, the EPA will use the color of one branch’s authority (the judiciary) to sidestep lacking authority from another branch (the legislature) in an effort to inflate the power of its own branch (the executive). As this transgression of separated powers is rather obvious, the EPA will claim instead that Section 111(d) already allows the Agency to craft performance standards for existing stationary sources.But a close analysis of the text of Section 111(d) suggests the EPA misreads its authority. In the 1990 Amendments, Congress expressly barred the EPA from setting Section 111(d) standards for source categories—like power plants—that are regulated under the Act’s Section 112 air toxics program.A. The History of Section 111(d)The history of Section 111(d) is critical to understanding how and why Congress barred the EPA from duplicative regulation of sources under Sections 111(d) and 112. As originally enacted in 1970, subsection (d)(1) read as follows:The Administrator shall prescribe regulations which shall establish a procedure similar to that provided by section 11042 under which each State shall submit to the Administrator a plan which (A) establishes emission standards for any existing source for any air pollutant (i) for which air quality criteria have not been issued or which is not included on a list published under section 108(a) or 112(b)(1)(A) but (ii) to which a standard of performance under subsection (b) would apply if such existing source were a new source, and (B) provides for the implementation and enforcement of such emission standards.43Accordingly, under the version of this subsection enacted in 1970, the EPA is precluded from using the 111(d) program to set standards for pollutants already regulated under either section 108 (the “criteria pollutants” of the NAAQS regime) or section 112 (the list of “hazardous air pollutants” or HAPs). In 1990, Congress amended Section 111(d) as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. As presented in the current version of the United States Code, 42 U.S.C. § 7411(d)(1) provides that:The Administrator shall prescribe regulations which shall establish a procedure similar to that provided by section 7410 of this title under which each State shall submit to the Administrator a plan which (A) establishes standards of performance44 for any existing source for any air pollutant (i) for which air criteria have not been issued or which is not included on a list published under section 7408(a) of this title or emitted from a source category which is regulated under section 7412 of this title[.](Emphases added.) The substitution of “or 112(b)(1)(A)” with “or emitted from a source category which is regulated under section 7412 of this title” originated in the House of Representatives’ version of the Amendments. Importantly, it alters the focus of the limitations on the EPA’s authority to regulate existing sources of air pollutants under Section 111. From its creation in 1970 until its amendment in 1990, this portion of the Act spoke only in terms of pollutants whose emission from existing sources fell outside the scope of Section 111(d)—i.e., those pollutants already subject to regulation under Sections 108 and 112 (the NAAQS and NESHAP regimes). The current text of

(Emphases added.) This reading, which fully enacts both amendments, is the correct and valid law. Although it is not reflected in the current text of the United States Code, the Code is only prima facie evidence of the law. Where the Code and the Statutes at Large conflict, the latter must prevail.51 Here, the text of the Statutes at Large contains both amendments.52 Moreover, this text of the amendments is the only one that is consistent with Congress’s intent in enacting both provisions.53This reading evinces that the two amendments to Section 111(d) place different limitations on the scope of EPA’s authority; these limitations are motivated by different purposes, address different aspects of EPA’s regulatory authority elsewhere in the Act, and are entirely capable of co-existing. As such, statutory construction compels they be read compatibly.54In enacting the House amendment, Congress added a limitation on the reach of 111(d): where a category of sources is being regulated under Section 112, Section 111(d) cannot be used to impose additional performance standards on that source category. The purpose of the House amendment is clear. In the 1990 Amendments, Congress changed the broader way that Section 112 operated, switching from a risk-based model to a technology-based one.55 Under the new approach, pollutant standards under Section 112 must reflect the “maximum achievable control technology,” or MACT. Aware that this change would significantly increase compliance burdens, the House intended with its amendment to ensure that existing source categories regulated under Section 112 would not face the prospect of additional costly regulation under Section 111.56Congress’ objective in precluding source category regulation is all the more obvious in light of the recent promulgation of new source performance standards for greenhouse gases. The EPA’s recently-enacted Utility MACT Rule imposes $11 billion in annual compliance costs, the vast majority of which are born by existing power plants.57 Preventing the EPA from “double-dipping” and imposing billions more in compliance costs on this source category through Section 111(d) is a feature of the 1990 Amendments, not a bug.In contrast, in enacting the Senate amendment, Congress intended to maintain the pre-1990 prohibition on using Section 111(d) to regulate emissions from existing sources of those substances regulated as hazardous pollutants under Section 112. Failing to retain the existing limit on EPA authority to regulate hazardous air pollutants under Section 112 would allow the Agency to undo Congress’ considered decision to regulate only certain sources of hazardous air pollutants—the 1990 Amendments require the EPA to regulate all major sources of hazardous air pollutants, but only 90 percent of emissions of area sources.58Thus, in accordance with this reading of Section 111(d), the EPA lacks authority to establish standards of performance for existing sources of air pollutants which —————————————————————————

This approach proved difficult and minimally effective at reducing emissions. As a result, when amending the Clean Air Act in 1990, Congress directed the EPA to use a ‘technology-based’ and performance-based approach to significantly reduce emissions of air toxics from major sources of air pollution, followed by a risk-based approach to addressany remaining, or residual, risks.” EPA, Taking Toxics out of the Air (Aug. 2000), available at http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/takingtoxics/p1.html.56 As further evidence that the House amendments had a deregulatory emphasis and were designed to ease the burden on regulated industries, note that the House amendment to 111(d) took place in the context of the House’s replacement of the Senate’s draft amendment to Section 112 with regard to power plant regulation.

are included on a list published under Sections 108(a) or 112(b) (a substance-focused limitation on authority) or which are emitted from source categories regulated under Section 112 (a source-focused limitation). Since power plants are regulated under Section 112,59 therefore, Section 111(d) does not provide the EPA with authority to establish standards of performance for greenhouse emissions therefrom.C. Even If Congress’s Intent Is Unclear, the Statute as Amended Can Be Read To Give Full Effect to Both Amendments to Section 111(d)Congress acted with intelligible and distinct intent in 1990 in enacting both the Senate and House amendments to Section 111(d). Yet even if the intent is unclear, courts are compelled by accepted rules of statutory construction to “harmonize” textual provisions “and give meaningful effect to all of the provisions” therein.60 Here, again, the EPA’s interpretation fails in properly applying the harmonization canon.The EPA will use its 2005 “harmonization” of Section 111(d)’s House and Senate amendments to combine the provisions into an unrecognizable regulation. In 2005, the EPA attempted to delist power plants from the list of sources of hazardous air pollutants subject to regulation under Section 112. Simultaneously, it sought to establish a cap-and-trade program for power plants’ mercury emissions under Section 111(d). The EPA based that program on the following interpretation of Section 111(d):Where a source category is being regulated under section 112, a section 111(d) standard of performance cannot be established to address any HAP listed under section 112(b) that may be emitted from that particular source category.61That construction suited EPA’s purposes in the delisting decision: The delisting decision was a precursor to the Agency’s Clean Air Mercury Rule (referenced supra as a precedent for cap-and-trade under Section 111(d)), and because mercury compounds are listed under Section 112(b), EPA’s interpretation allowed it to establish Section 111(d) standards of performance for their emission from power plants after the delisting decision. In this way, the EPA did what the harmonization canon works to avoid: only giving “some effect to both provisions” rather than giving “meaningful effect to all of the provisions.”62 The result is the creation of an unidentifiable, alternative provision from what Congress passed.The D.C. Circuit vacated the EPA’s mercury cap-and-trade program because it held that the EPA’s delisting decision proceeded under the incorrect statutory authority.63 The court did not, however, rule on the EPA’s construction of Section 111(d). Now, to carry out its settlement agreement, the EPA will look to use this reformulation of Section 111(d) to put stationary, existing energy sources like power plants regulated under Section 112 in its sights for greenhouse gas regulation.A proper application of the harmonization canon is the same as in the plain-meaning interpretation of the Clean Air Act: both the Senate and the House amendments limit the reach of Section 111(d). As explained supra, Congress’ two amendments to Section 111(d) accomplish separate goals: The amendment originating in the House of Representatives is a deregulatory provision that precludes industries from being hit by the double-punch of Section 112 and Section 111(d); the amendment originating in the Senate preserves Section 112 as the exclusive mechanism for regulating hazardous air pollutants under the Act. These provisions do not conflict in any way. Rather, they complement each other.In contrast, the EPA weakens both of Congress’s Section 111(d) amendments in its construction from the delisting decision. The amendment originating in the House, which Congress intended as a deregulatory provision for industries that were subject to Section 112 regulation, is given no effect at all—under the previous version of Section 111(d) and the Senate Bill, regulation ——————————59 See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(n)(1); see also supra note 45.60 New Process Steel, L.P. v.

of hazardous air pollutants was already precluded for all source categories. Also, the amendment originating in the Senate, which was intended to maintain Section 112 as the exclusive program for hazardous air pollutant regulation from stationary sources, is given diluted effect through a source category limitation imported from the House’s amendment.In other words, the EPA offered a construction that neither retains those limitations (as would the Senate amendment standing alone), nor alters them (as would the House amendment alone), but rather shrinks them. This construction is not permissible under either classic statutory construction canons or the administrative law analysis of delegated agency authority.Under step one of a Chevron analysis, “[i]f the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”64 Thus, as long as the intent of the amendments taken individually is clear, and as long as they are capable of simultaneous implementation, “that is the end of the matter.” As described supra, and as the EPA recognized in its delisting decision,65 neither amendment read independently evinces intent to weaken the existing limitations on 111(d). No permissible attempt to harmonize the two can achieve that result.Finally, even if, under the first step of a Chevron analysis, the intent of Congress is not clear, a court will not simply accept an agency’s interpretation of its governing statute without further inquiry. Instead, in the second step of Chevron analysis, a court must consider “whether the agency’s [interpretation] is based on a permissible construction of the statute.”66 The interpretation of the two amendments offered by the EPA in 2005 is not permissible, since it weakens the pre-1990 limitations on Section 111(d) and, in so doing, gives meaningful effect to neither amendment.The EPA’s likely response to this analysis would be to emphasize the Agency’s entitlement to deference in defining the scope of vague and ambiguous statutes. 
Here, the EPA could follow the arguments of some commentators that look at the history of Section 111(d) and conclude that the section’s language is meant to provide a “gap filler” for incremental cap-and-trade implementation within the CAA amendments.67It is true that “even without express authority to fill a specific statutory gap, circumstances pointing to implicit congressional delegation” may require courts to defer to agencies’ interpretations of their governing statutes.68 But here, there is neither express nor implicit delegation of “gap-filling” authority. The admittedly unusual drafting history here calls not for discretionary administrative decision-making, but rather the traditional exercise of core judicial functions of statutory construction. Failing to exercise de novo review over the EPA’s interpretation of the statute would be to claim without proof that Congress desired the Agency to resolve what it never could through the transparency of democracy: whether the federal government should enact a cap-and-trade regulatory regime. Yet, as the Supreme Court has confirmed, “Congress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.”69 In short, two decades of failed Congressional attempts at cap-and-trade do not make it magically manifest in Section 111(d).D. Alternatively, the House Amendment Can Be Read as Implicitly Repealing the Senate AmendmentThere is a third and final possible reading of the statute if the EPA or a court were convinced that Congress did not intend to enact both amendments to Section 111(d) and that the amendments cannot be harmonized: that the amendment originating in the House of Representatives implicitly repeals the Senate amendment. In that case, the plain meaning of Section 111(d), as amended to preclude existing source performance standards for industries regulated ———————————————64 Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43.65 See 70 Fed.

under the Clean Air Act’s Section 112 air toxics program—reflected by the U.S. Code only containing the House amendment—would preclude the EPA’s anticipated greenhouse gas standards. While this interpretation of the statute and its amendments is not ideal, in that it would not honor the intent of the Senate amendment and would remove an important substance-focused limitation on the Agency’s authority under the subsection, it is at least a coherent theory of what Congress intended—and it results in a workable statute. The EPA’s response to this argument would likely be that the amendments can be harmonized, but its theory of harmonization must fail for the reasons discussed above. If the amendments are not both honored in full, the House amendment should take precedence over the one that originated in the Senate.The canon of implied repeal applies where there is “an irreconcilable conflict between the two federal statutes at issue.”70 Although the Supreme Court has suggested that it applies only in the case of “earlier and later statutes [that] are irreconcilable,”71 there is no case law directly stating that this canon is inapplicable to irreconcilable earlier and later amendments to a single bill.In this regard, if Congress did not intend both amendments to Section 111(d) in the 1990 Amendments to be enacted, it would have intended the House of Representatives’ amendment to control. The 1990 Amendments originated in the Senate, which passed S.1630 on April 3, 1990.72 This version of S.1630 contained the revised text of Section 112, which removed the old Section 112(b)(1)(A) and replaced it with a new Section 112(b)(1) containing a list of hazardous air pollutants, as explained above.73 It also contained the conforming amendment to Section 111(d),74 which—under this interpretation—did nothing more than alter the reference to Section 112 found in Section 111(d) to reflect the new organization of Section 112.The House, in turn, amended and passed S.1630 on May 23, 1990.75 The version passed by the house added the House amendment,76 which removed the (now-obsolete) reference to “112(b)(1)(A)” found in Section 111(d) and replaced it with the phrase “or emitted from a source category which is regulated under Section 112.” In so doing, the House amendment effected a substantive change in the limitations imposed on Section 111(d), where the Senate amendment merely altered a reference to conform to changes made elsewhere in the Act. But the House neglected to strike the Senate’s “conforming amendment,” and the bill was reconciled at conference with the now-obsolete Senate amendment left intact.77 As between a technical and conforming amendment in a prior version of the legislation, and a substantive amendment designed to alter the scope of Section 111(d), the substantive amendment should be the one that is given full force and effect if the two amendments are irreconcilable. As such, whether the different amendments to Section 111(d) in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are complementary, harmonized, or conflict, the common theme is that the EPA cannot promulgate existing source performance standards for source categories that are regulated under Section 112, such as power plants.III. ConclusionWhile the courts will grant the EPA broad deference to determine a permissible reading of Section 111(d), the Agency cannot adopt an interpretation repelled by the statute’s text.78 Here, the controlling Statutes-At-Large text of Section 111(d) precludes the EPA’s contorted attempt to reformulate the listing of stationary energy sources so as to include them in a 70 Matsushita Elec.

0.02°C Temperature Rise Averted: The Vital
Number Missing from the EPA’s “By the
Numbers” Fact Sheet

By Paul C. "Chip" Knappenberaer and Patrick J. Michaels
http://www.cato.org/blog/002degc-temperature-rise-averted-vital-number—missinc-epas—
numbers-tact-sheet

Global Science Report is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science, where we highlight
one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader
and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly "Current Wisdom. "
—————————————————————
 
Last week, the Obama Administration‘s US. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) unveiled
a new set of proposed regulations aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from existing U.
S. power plants, The motivation for the EPA’s plan comes from the President’s desire to address
and mitigate anthropogenic climate change.

We hate to be the party poopers. but the new regulations will do no such thing.

The EPA‘s regulations seek to limit carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production in the
year 2030 to a level 30 percent below what they were in 2005. It is worth noting that power plant
C02 emissions already dropped by about 15% from 2005 to 2012, largely, because of market
forces which favor less-Coz-emitting natural gas over coal as the fuel of choice for producing
electricity. Apparently the President wants to lock in those gains and manipulate the market to
see that the same decline takes place in twice the time, Nothing like government intervention to
facilitate market inefficiency. But we digress.

The EPA highlighted what the plan would achieve in their “By the Numbers” Fact Sheet that
accompanied their big announcement.

For some reason. they left off their Fact Sheet how much climate change would be averted by the
plan. Seems like a strange omission since, after all. without the threat of climate change, there
would be no one thinking about the forced abridgement of our primary source of power
production in the first place. and the Administration’s new emissions restriction scheme
wouldn't even be a gleam in this or any other president's eye.

But no worries. What the EPA left out, we‘ll fill in.

Page 269

Using a simple, publically-available, climate model emulator called MAGICC that was in part
developed through support of the EPA, we ran the numbers as to how much future temperature
rise would be averted by a complete adoption and adherence to the EPA”s new carbon dioxide
restrictions".

The answer? Less than two one—hundredths of a degree Celsius by the year 2100.

0.018°C to be exact.

We’re not even sure how to put such a small number into practical terms, because, basically, the
number is so small as to be undetectable.

Which, no doubt. is why it’s not included in the EPA Fact Sheet.

It is not too small, however, that it shouldn’t play a huge role in every and all discussions of the
new regulations.

* * * * * * *

* Details and Additional Information about our Calculation

We have used the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change
(MAGICC)——a simple climate model emulator that was, in part. developed through support of
the EPA—to examine the climate impact of proposed regulations.

MAGICC version 6 is available as an on-line tool.

We analyzed the climate impact of the new EPA regulations by modifying future emissions
scenarios that have been established by the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), to reflect the new EPA proposed emissions targets.

Specifically, the three IPCC scenarios we examined were the Representative Concentration
Pathways (RCPs) named RCP4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP8.5. RCP4.5 is a low-end emissions
pathway, RCP6.0 is more middle of the road, and RCP8.5 is a high—end pathway.

The emissions prescriptions in the RCPs are not broken down on a country by country basis. but
rather are defined for country groupings. The U.S. is included in the OECD90 group.

To establish the U.S. emissions pathway within each RPC, we made the following assumptions:

1) US. carbon dioxide emissions make up 50 percent of the OECD90 carbon dioxide emissions.

2) Carbon dioxide emissions from electrical power production make up 40 percent of the total
US. carbon dioxide emissions.

Page 270

figure 1 shows the carbon dioxide emissions pathways of the original RCPs along with our
determination within each of the contribution from U.S. electricity production.

<See Original Document for Figure “Carbon Dioxide Emissions Scenarios”>

Figure 1. Carbon dioxide emissions pathways defined in, or derived from, the original set of
Representative Concentration pathways (RCPs), for the global total carbon dioxide emissions as
well as far the carbon dioxide emissions attributable to U.S. electricity production.

As you can pretty quickly tell, the projected contribution of U .3. carbon dioxide emissions from
electricity production to the total global carbon dioxide emissions is vanishingly small.

The new EPA regulations apply to the lower three lines in Figure 1.

To examine the impact of the EPA proposal, we replace the emissions attributable to U.S. power
plants in the original RCPs with targets defined in the new EPA regulations. We determined
those targets to be (according to the EPA’S Regulatory Impacts Analysis accompanying the
regulation), 0.4864 GtC in 2020 and 0.4653 GtC in 2030. Thereafter, the U.S. power plant
emissions were held constant at the 2030 levels until they fell below those levels in the original
RCP prescriptions (specifically, that occurred in 2060 in RPC4.5, 2100 in RCP6.0, and sometime
after 2150 in RCP8.5).

We then used MAGICC to calculate the rise in global temperature projected to occur between
now and the year 2100 when with the original RCPs as well as with the RCPs modified to reflect

Page 271

the EPA proposed regulations (we used the MAGICC default value for the earth's equilibrium
climate sensitivity (3.0°C)).

The output from the six MAGICC runs is depicted as figure 2.

Figure 2. Global average surface temperature anomalies, 2000-2100. as projected by MA GICC‘
rim with the original RC'I’s as well as with the set of RCPS modified to reflect the EPA 30%
emissions reductions from U.S. power plants.

In case you can’t tell the impact by looking at figure 2 (since the lines are basically on top of one
another). we’ve summarized the numbers in Table 1.

Table 1. Projected surface temperature anomaly (C)

Scenario 	2013 	2100 	Temp. Change (C)

RCP6.0 		1.043 	3.203 	2.161

RCP6.0-EPA	1.042	3.185	2.143
RCP8.5-EPA	1.072	4.710	3.638

In Table 2, we quantify the amount of projected temperature rise that is averted by the new EPA
regulations.

Center for the Study of Science, Cato Institute

The rise in projected future temperature rise that is averted by the proposed EPA restrictions of
carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants is less than 002°C between now and the
end of the century assuming the IPCC‘s middle—of-the—road future emissions scenario.

While the proposed EPA plan seeks only to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, in practice, the
goal is to reduce the burning of coal. Reducing the burning of coal will have co-impacts such as
reducing other climatically active trace gases and particulate matter (or its precursors). We did
not model the effects of changes in these co-species as sensitivity tests using MAGICC indicate
the collective changes in these co-emissions are quite small and largely cancel each other out.

CHINA: Nation announces plan to cap carbon emissions

Published: Tuesday. June 3. 2014
http://www.eenewsnet/greenwire/stories/1060000611/print

China today announced plans to set a nationwide cap on carbon emissions in 2016, a move that
could be a turning point in UN. climate change negotiations starting this week in Germany.

The cap will go into effect when China‘s next five-year economic growth plan starts in 2016, He
Jiankun, chairman of China's Advisory Committee on Climate Change, said at a conference in
Beijing. Details of the plan, including the level of the CO2 cap, likely won't be finalized until
next year.

China's announcement comes on the eve of 10-day U.N. climate talks among 190 nations
scheduled to start tomorrow in Bonn, Germany (ClimateWire, June 2).

The plan also follows the Obama administration’s announcement yesterday of a proposed rule
curbing greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. China and the United States are
the world’s two largest emitters of carbon dioxide.

The proposals could mark a breakthrough in efforts to reach an international climate change
treaty, experts said.

"It sends a very powerful signal to the rest of the world to get serious," said John Connor, CEO
of the Melbourne-based Climate Institute (Chen/Reklev, Reuters, June 3). -- DB

 
NATIONS: Some indications that China may be preparing to cap its carbon emissions
Lisa Friedman, E&E reporter
Published: Wednesday, June 4, 2014

http://wwweenews.net/climatewire/stories/1060000681/print

A leading Chinese scholar’s assertion that China is poised to enact a carbon emissions cap was
met with praise and caution in the United States yesterday.

He Jiankun, a professor at Tsinghua University and deputy director of China‘s National Expert
Committee on Climate Change, set off alarm bells when Reuters reported his comments that
China will make its greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2030.

Coming on the heels of the Obama administration's announcement of a 30 percent cut in power
plant emissions by 2030, He's statement heightened hope for the international climate
negotiations.

Page 274

But He is not a government official. And in a country not known for its transparency, observers
said deciphering whether the professor spoke with the government‘s blessing or was merely
repeating a position he has long advocated and researched —— publishing a report on the subject in
the journal Energy Policy in 2012 -- is a tricky business.

"What he said shouldn't be considered official. but he is one of the most important advisers on
climate change. His views are very important, and his team is very involved in this research,"
said Ailun Yang, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute think tank.

Speaking at a conference in Beijing, He said an emissions cap would be included in the China's
next five-year plan, which covers the years 2016-20. The peak will likely come in 2030, he told
Reuters, with China's emissions at about 11f billion metric tons of C02 equivalent.

"The government will use two ways to control C02 emissions in the next five—year plan, by
intensity and an absolute cap." he said.

Yang said part of the Chinese government's strategy includes using advisers to ﬂoat policies
before they are official and called He's comments significant. Others, though, noted that the
Chinese government has given no indication that an official policy is forthcoming.

Mixed signals

”There are a handful of scholars in China who are really important to the [climate change] policy
discussion," and He is one of them. said Joanna Lewis, an assistant professor at Georgetown
University and expert on Chinese energy policy. But, she noted, "Their academic work is
certainly influential to policy. It doesn‘t set policy."

The comments also sparked a wave of inaccuracies. A number of news outlets reported that the
cap would come in 2016; others erroneously described He's comments as China‘s official
emissions pledge to the U.N. climate change treaty talks.

Yang Fuqiang, a senior adviser on energy and climate change at the Natural Resources Defense
Council in Beijing, said, “I think Reuters misinterpreted He Jiankun’s point. He did not say China
will set a total emissions cap in 2016. He said China will set the cap in the nation’s next five-year
development plan, which ranges from 2016 to 2020."

Indeed, by evening yesterday. He had backpedaled, telling Reuters that his comments had been
only his "personal view."

He could not be reached by ClimateWire for comment.

Still, climate analysts said that whether or not He’s statements were an indication of policy to
come, China does have major new policies in the works.

Lewis noted that last year, for the first time ever, the country known for building "a power plant
per week" installed more non-fossil-fuel power capacity than fossil-fuel capacity. Meanwhile,

Page 275

she said. the government in light of devastating air pollution problems is considering a total cap
on coal consumption by 2020. That, she noted, opens the door to a peak emissions year.

NRDC's Yang agreed, saying that He's predictions are also in line with his expectations. He said
that if China's coal consumption peaks by 2020, which many researchers believe will happen.
there is near certainty that emissions will then peak by 2030.

"The possibility that China's coal consumption will peak by 2020 is very high," he said. "In the
past, there was no consensus among government institutes, companies and the general public in
terms of reducing coal use. But since air pollution has become a crisis in China, we have that
consensus now," Yang said. "The central government has exerted so much effort, spent so much
money and got the Chinese society on its side. If this still can't bring a peak on coal
consumption, 1 don‘t know what can."

In Bonn, Germany, where diplomats are meeting for a midyear U.N. climate negotiating session,
both the U.S. power plant targets and the suggestion from China were greeted with
circumspection by representatives of the countries most affected by climate change.

”We welcome the emission reduction announcements by the two top GHG emitters, because
these provide high hopes for the success of 2015 agreement," Prakash Mathema, who leads the
group of least-developed countries in the negotiations. told Climate Wire.

But he said both possible targets, "whilst useful, may not be enough to put the world on a less-
than~2—degree-Celsius pathway. So we look forward to further improvements in these policies,
and announcements from other big emitters, as well."

Behind the Mask —- A Reality Check on China’s Plans for a Carbon Cap

By ANDREW REVKIN

June 3, 2014

http://mobile.nvtimes.com/blogs/dotearth/2014/06/03/behind-the—mask-a~reaIity-check-on-chinas-
plans-for-a-carbon-cap/

BEIJING — Having covered China’s stance on global warming since 1988, I’ve gotten attuned
to the need to tread carefully when something is said that feels like a shift in the official position
of this greenhouse gas giant.

The ancient Chinese mask—changing dance that I saw here Tuesday night (at a dinner for
participants in a meeting on science and sustainable development) came to mind in considering
the unraveling of news a few hours earlier of an official Chinese plan for a firm cap on emissions

Page 276

of carbon dioxide, hard on the heels of President Obama’s proposed carbon pollution rules for
existing American power plants.

Here’s how things played out. An adviser to the Chinese government on climate change was
Quoted by Reuters as saying the following at a Beijing climate—policy conference on Tuesday:

The government will use two ways to control CO2 emissions in the next five-year plan. by
intensity and an absolute cap.

The comment came from He Jiankun, a professor at Tsinghua University and deputy director of
China’s Expert Committee on Climate Change, speaking at an international forum on market
mechanisms for low-carbon development sponsored by Tsinghua and Harvard University.

 The story quickly pivoted to how significant this would be given the context of President
Obama‘s move and informal climate talks starting on Wednesday in Bonn, Germany, aimed at
setting the stage for fresh climate treaty work later this year at the United Nations and in Lima.
Peru.

The Guardian quickly followed Reuters with “China Pledges to limit Carbon Emissions for the first 
time,” a piece canvassing climate campaigners but offering no reinforcing input from the
Chinese government.

I consulted with The Times’s Beijng bureau. Christopher Buckley, a reporter [based in Hong
Kong] who in 2011 had covered China‘s emissions plans [and similar pushes from advisers to
adopt a cap] while with Reuters, spoke with He Jiankun, who told him repeatedly that he did not
in any way speak for the government, or the full expert climate committee.

Here’s Buckley’s translation:

It’s not the case that the Chinese government has made any decision. This is a suggestion from
experts, because now they are exploring how emissions can be controlled in the 13th five Year
Plan... This is a View of experts; that’s not saying it"s the government‘s, I’m not a government
official and I don’t represent the government.

A Reuters reporter told me tonight that a correction was being posted [it’s berg], but not before
other newspapers — including USA Todav with a piece on China’s “emissions pledge“ — built on
the report.

Other, more recent news coverage has reﬂected that this isn’t China‘s position, although many
experts in Beijing (including at the meeting I‘m participating in) foresee an eventual cap and a
peak in China’s emissions sometime after 2030.

Here’s more from other news outlets. The China News Service, a state-run news agency, also
reported on the comments made by Professor He at the Tsinghua-Harvard forum but made no
mention of proposals for a quantitative cap on carbon dioxide emissions.

Page 277

The financial Times posted “China climate adviser urges emissions cap.”

Recalling that all energy forecasts need to be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism, best
guesses for a peak in China’s greenhouse gas emissions tend to center on the 20305, as reﬂected
in this paper earlier this year in the journal Energy Policy: “Peak energy consumption and CO2
emissions in China.”

Here’s the abstract:

China is in the processes of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Based on the Kaya identity
[a formula drawing on economic activity: energy use and other factors to determine a country’s
Greenhouse-gas impact], this paper proposes an analytical framework for various energy
scenarios that explicitly simulates China’s economic development, with a prospective
consideration on the impacts of urbanization and income distribution. With the framework,
China's 2050 energy consumption and associated C02 reduction scenarios are constructed. Main
findings are: (1) energy consumption will peak at 5200—5400 milliontons coal equivalent (Mtce)
in 2035~2040; (2) C02 emissions will peak at 92007-9400 million tons (Mt) in 2030~2035, whilst
it can be potentially reduced by 200—300Mt: (3) China’s per capita energy consumption and per
capita C02 emission are projected to peak at 4tce and 6.8t respectively in 2020—2030, soon after
China steps into the high income group.

Things could potentially speed up, as some have noted. but there are limits to the pace at which
China can develop enough cleaner energy alternatives to cutback on coal burning. Professor He
noted this in the Reuters article:

He said China’s greenhouse gas emissions would only peak in 2030, at around 1 1 billion tonnes
of CO2-equivalent. Its emissions currently stand at around 7-9.5 billion tonnes. But He said that
would depend on China achieving a real reduction in coal consumption from sometime around
2020 or 2025, and on the nation meeting its target of having l50-200 gigawatts of nuclear power
capacity by 2030. The share of non-fossil fuels in China‘s energy mix would reach 20 to 25
percent in 2030, He added.

Once an emissions peak and rough timeline are clearer, you can be sure a cap will be announced
— but only when the trajectories are already in place to make it a sure bet.

We‘re already locked in for substantial human driven climate change, but the intensifying focus
on a post—fossil future in both China and the United States points to a real prospect that much of
the world‘s remaining coal will stay in the ground in the end.

Addendum 1 To get a clearer view of China’s stance on who needs to do what, and when, on C02
emissions, click back to my interview last fall with Zen Ji, the deputy director of China’s
National Center for Climate Change Strategy.

Responses by Daniel Botkin to Additional Questions

Environment and Public Works Committee Hearing June 18, 2014
Follow-up Questions for Written Submission

To: Senators Barbara Boxer, Chairman, and David Vitter. Rankinq Member.
Environment and Public Works Committee.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify at this Senate hearing. Since the topic of the
hearing, “Climate Change: The Need to Act Now," concerned a scientific topic and the
application of science to policy, and since I was the only professional scientist testifying
at the hearing, and since there was, as a result, a question as to who is a scientific
expert, I would like to add the following information to the record, with the hope that this
will be useful to the Committee in its future consideration of this important question.

I come to you as a scientist, not a politician, not as a member of a specific
political party (I vote as an independent). My doctorate is in biology (Rutgers University
1968) and since 1968 I have done research on the theory of global warming and its
possible ecological effects. I would like to put into the record a list of my scientific
publications that have dealt with many aspects of this topic, as follows:

Billionaire Koch Brothers Gear Up To Spend Hundreds Of Millions in 2014

It's a been busy month for the billionaire right-wing donors and industrialists Charles
and David Koch. The brothers, along with their Spiderweb of dark money groups, are
actively raising vast sums of money to inﬂuence federal, state, and even local elections
and promote policies that benefit their bottom line at the expense of everyone else.

Here is some of the latest reported news of what the Kochs are up to these day:

* Planning To Spend Nearlv $300 Million On The 2014 Elections. in an exclusive
retreat at a fancy California resort near Laguna Beach last week, the Koch brothers
and wealthy allies unveiled a new strategy for the 2014 elections with an initial
fundraising target of $290 million. The retreat, which featured political allies
including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and libertarian political scientist Charles
Murray, is the most recent of a number of big and small gatherings so far to
appeal to select wealthy conservative donors.


* Starting A New Dedicated Anti-Environment: Effort. As leaders of a vast oil-and-
gas conglomerate, the Koch brothers have a direct financial interest in blocking
regulations to curb carbon pollution. They already fund a multitude of right-wing
anti-environment groups, including the American Energy Alliance, which has
targeted Democrats for potentially supporting a carbon tax. Now, the Kochs are
dedicating a new initiative under their central fundraising network Freedom
Partners that will aim to repeal successful state renewable energy standards and
block the president's proposed regulations to cut carbon emissions from power

Page 285

5119/2014 Here Come The Kochs |3 ThinkProgress

 

Launching A New Super PAC to Send Millions in Direct Support For Right-
Wing Candidates. Previously the Koch brothers mostly funded their 
unprecedented political spending into issue based attack ads slamming
progressive policies. That’s how changing. As reported yesterday, the Koch
network is starting a new Super PAC called Freedom Partners Action Fund that
plans to spend at least $15 million in 2014 supporting right-wing candidates (as
well as attacking progressives, as you might expect).

*Continuing To invest Heavily In_State And Local Policymaking. Americans For
Prosperity, traditionally the Koch brothers’ most active political arm, is ramping up
staff in states across the country to prepare for the 2014 elections and give a more
intense focus toward state and local politics and policy. Paid staff is now at 240 in
32 states, up from 100 in 2010. The group’s president, Tim Phillips, isn‘t shy about
their desire to inﬂuence policy at any level: ”at the state level, I would argue, it's
been a once-in-a-generation moment of free—market policy victories."

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been working to expose the influence
that the Koch brothers have on American politics. In the wake of the recent Supreme
Court decisions striking down contribution limits, he has forcefully pushed for a
constitutional amendment to put limits on campaign spending and called the ﬂood of
dark money like the Koch brothers’ "the greatest threat to our democracy that l have
witnessed during my time in public service."

BOTTOM LINE: The Koch brothers' enormous spending to inﬂuence elections and
policy outcomes is not slowing down at all in 2014. if anything, it is becoming more
expansive, with new organizations joining the network and an increased focus on the
state and local level. The more they spend trying to influence our political system to
protect their bottom lines at the expense of everyone else, the more important it
becomes to expose their goal and work to stop their outsized influence.

Kochs launch new super PAC for midterm fight

By Kenneth P. Vogel and Darren Goode

June 16.2014 08:20 PM EDT

During a closed-door gathering of major donors in Southern California on Monday. the
political operation spearheaded by the Koch brothers unveiled a significant new weapon in
its rapidly expanding arsenal — a super PAC called Freedom Partners Action Fund.

The new group aims to spend more than $15 million in the 2014 midterm campaigns — part
of a much larger spending effort expected to total $290 million, sources told POLITICO,

It’s an evolution for billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch. The vast network of
political nonprofit groups they helped build has mostly funneled its unprecedented political
spending into issue-based campaigns that usually slam Democrats for supporting big
government but seldom explicitly ask voters to support GOP candidates.

(Also on POLITICO: Inside the money wars)

That‘s expected to change under Freedom Partners Action F und, according to Marc Short,
president of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, an increasingly powerful force in the
Koch network that will operate in association with the new super PAC.

“The Freedom Partners Action Fund will support candidates who share our vision of free
markets and a free society and oppose candidates who support intrusive government
policies that push the American Dream out of reach for the American people," Short told
POLITICO after a presentation to donors at the St. Regis Monarch Beach resort in Dana
Point, California.

The gathering is the latest in a series of twice-annual so-called seminars that the Kochs started
holding in 2003 to raise cash from wealthy donors after treating them to a series of slickly
produced presentations from handpicked politicians, conservative media stars and
operatives from Koch-backed groups.

(Also on POLITICO: Hobby Lobby aims for Obamacare win. Christian nation)

Freedom Partners, which was created in 2011. now organizes and hosts the seminars. The
theme of the St. Regis seminar— “American Courage; Our commitment to a free society‘ -
was printed on massive posters evoking an idyllic turn—of-the-century immigration motif. The
posters, which depicted an immigrant family gazing in awe at the Statue of Liberty in the
distance, were displayed throughout the St. Regis. A photo of one was provided upon
request to POLITICO by Freedom Partners spokesman James Davis, who explained that the
purpose of the seminar was “continued discussions about advancing a free society with the
theme of American Courage."

Among the dignitaries who was scheduled to address the crowd was Sen. Marco Rubio (R-
Fla.), whose office declined to comment on his appearance, It was initially reported by the Daily
Beast, which also first reported the $290 million overall Spending goal.

Democrats are sure to seize on the new Freedom Partners super PAC as yet more fodder in
their mounting campaign to caricature the brothers as evil puppeteers manipulating Republicans.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent a fundraising missive Sunday
declaring the Daily Beast’s report “AWFUL NEWS" and pleading "if we can't start closing this
gap TODAY, the Koch brothers WlLt. buy the election for John Boehner and the GOP.”

A spokesman for Koch industries, the Koch brothers’ privately held industrial conglomerate,
referred all questions to Freedom Partners. A Koch industries website entry posted before
Freedom Partners took over responsibility for the seminars describes them as an opportunity
for “America‘s greatest philanthropists and most successful business leaders" to ”discuss
solutions to our most pressing issues and strategies to promote policies that will help grow
our economy, foster free enterprise and create American jobs."

The events are typically held under extremely tight security and attendees are warned not to
divulge the proceedings. They typically conclude with pledge sessions that have almost a
revival-type feel where it‘s not unusual for donors to promise six— and seven-figure checks into
the political cash pool that is now administered by Freedom Partners. Since most of the
groups in the network don’t disclose individual donations, the names of the donors are often
kept secret

The new super PAC, by contrast, will be obligated to disclose its donors, which makes it
unique in Koch World and seems to be part of a move by Freedom Partners to introduce
some transparency into the network's activities.

Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, unlike the super PAC, is registered as a 501(c)6
trade association, a section of the Tax Code that allows groups to shield donors’ names. it
initially acted as something of a bank for the Koch network, mostly writing grants to other groups
to air ads or mobilize activists around small—government, free—market issues, But Freedom
Partners, which doled out $236 million in grants in 2012, is playing an increasingly larger role,
including airing its own ads, as the Koch network moves to centralize its political operations.

During breakout sessions Sunday at the St. Regis, Freedom Partners research director
Karen Steward joined veteran Koch aide Nancy Pfotenhauer, now a senior adviser to the
group, to talk about its expanded spending on energy-related issues, which is expected to
include more than $13 million in spending ahead of the midterms.

The energy initiative is seen by Koch Kremlinologists as emblematic of Freedom Partners‘
growth. Whereas in 2012, the group donated $1.5 million to American Energy Alliance, a
nonprofit group that aired $3.6 million of ads attacking President Barack Obama over rising gas
prices, now Freedom Partners is increasingly also taking on such campaigns itself.

AEA president Tom Pyle welcomed Freedom Partners' expanded footprint, which he cast as
important in winning an increasingly contentious debate around energy issues and greenhouse
gas emissions that has drawn big—spending by deep—pocketed environmental groups and liberal
donors. The retired San Francisco hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer is planning to
underwrite a $100-million campaign to elect candidates who support aggressive efforts to


Page 288

combat climate change. Steyer has sought cash for his political effort from rich donors who
attend secretive gatherings of the liberal Democracy Alliance club, which bears some similarities to
the Koch network and its meetings,

“The fact that the Freedom Partners network has recognized this and is throwing their hat into
the ring on energy and environmental issues is welcoming news," said Pyle. “We’re pleased
that they are joining the fight to promote free market energy policies that will improve the lives
of millions of Americans."

The Koch network raised $70 million at its first donor seminar of the 2014 election cycle in
April 2013, as revealed in the new book, "Big Money: 2.5 Billion Dollars, One suspicious Vehicle, and a
Pimp— on the Trail of the Ultra-Rich Hijacking American Politics." And the Daily Beast reported that the
network collected nearly $170 million in pledges at its January seminar, making $290 million
a seemingly attainable goal.

The projected tally underscores the migration of power and money away from the political
party committees to major donors and outside groups, generally, and the Koch network
specifically. in 2012, the biggest spending party congressional campaign arm - Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee —— spent only $183 million.

Re: EPA’s Asserted Authority Under Section 11.1(d) Of The Clean Air Act To
Regulate C02 Emissions From Existing Coal—fired Power Plants

Dear Administrator McCarthy:

On June 2, 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) launched
one of the most far-reaching and expensive regulatory projects in American history: the Carbon
Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units
(“Proposed Rule").] The Proposed Rule seeks to impose limitations on C0; emitted from
existing coal-fired power plants, requiring a staggering 30% reduction in the emissions from
these plants across the country in a more 15 years. West Virginian, a major consumer of coal-
generated electricity and one of the leading producers of coal—-will be uniquely harmed by the
restrictions of the Proposed Rule.

As the chief legal officer for the State of West Virginia, I respectfully request that you
withdraw the Proposed Rule immediately because EPA lacks the legal authority to adopt that
Rule. In the Legal Memorandum for Proposed Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for
Existing Electric Utility Generating Units (“Legal Memorandum” or “Mem,”) that was issued
together with and incorporated by reference into the Proposed Rule,[2] EPA offers only one legal
basis for the Rule: the rarely invoked Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). See 42
U.S.C. § 741 1(d). The problem is that Section 111(d) affirmatively excludes precisely what EPA
is attempting to do in the Proposed Rule.

1 The Rule has not yet been published in the Federal Register and is currently available at
http://wwwz.epa.gov/sites/productioMiles/2014»05/documents/20l40602proposal—cleanpowerplan.pdf.

As this letter explains, EPA lacks authority under the plain text of Section lll(d), as it
appears in the United States Code, to promulgate the Proposed Rule. Section 111(d) expressly
prohibits EPA from regulating “any air pollutant . . . emitted from a[n] [existing] source category
which is regulated under {the national emission regime in Section 112 of the CAA}.” 42
USC. § 7411(d). Given that EPA has imposed extensive and onerous regulations on existing
coal—fired power plants under Section 112, the agency cannot now use Section 111(d) to require
regulation of C02 emissions from those same existing plants. This conclusion is so apparent that
even EPA concedes in its Legal Memorandum that a “literal reading” ofSection 111(d) prohibits
the Proposed Rule. Mom. 26; see also 70 Fed. Reg. 15,994, 16,032 (Mar. 29, 2005) (EPA
making the same admission in a prior rulemaking),

The only textual justification that EPA’s Legal Memorandum offers for departing from
the “literal” terms of Section 111(d) is unpersuasive. The agency relies entirely on a one-
sentence clerical entry in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act that was not codified in the
US. Code but appears in the Statutes at Large. That entry, even EPA has admitted, was clearly a
mistake because it sought to make a technical correction rendered moot by another amendment.
See 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031 (describing the entry as a “drafting error”). Nevertheless, EPA now
claims that it must give meaning to this mistake and, as a result, has announced an interpretation
of Section 111(d) that directly conﬂicts with the language in the US. Code. EPA’s interpretation
rewrites Section 111(d) from a prohibition on the regulation of "any air pollutant . . . emitted
from a source category which is regulated under [Section 1 12],” as stated in the [1.8. Code, to a
more limited prohibition on the regulation of “any hazardous air pollutant” emitted from such a
source category. This sort of reasoning would be wrong under any circumstance, but it is
particularly improper here, where it is being offered as the justification for one of the most costly
regulations in this Nation’s history.

in light of the profound legal infirmities with the Proposed Rule, EPA‘S unprecedented
policy will not survive judicial review. As such, it would be contrary to the public interest to
proceed with publication in the Federal Register. Failure to withdraw the Proposed Rule will
only cause citizens, States, industry, and environmental groups to waste valuable resources
analyzing and commenting on a futile endeavor. Moreover. given the short timeframe for
compliance with the Rule’s objectives, many of these parties will be required to incur significant
and unnecessary costs. This will trigger unwarranted market responses and economic dislocation
from coerced reduction of the use of coal as parties struggle to meet the anticipated requirements.
This is unacceptable. No matter how fervent the desire by some to advance the policies
underlying these regulations, EPA cannon—and should not do so at the expense of the rule of
law.

A. EPA Has Conceded That The Proposed Rule Is Unlawful Under The “Literal”
Terms Of The Clean Air Act

The only authority invoked by EPA for the onerous requirements in the Proposed Rule is
Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, a little-used provision that grants EPA limited power to
require States to regulate air pollutants from existing sources. Mom. 11—12. As it appears in the
US. Code, Section lll(d) requires the EPA Administrator under narrow circumstances to

Page 291

The Honorable Gina McCarthy

Page 3

“prescribe regulations which shall establish a procedure , . . under which each State shall submit
to the Administrator a plan which establishes standards of performance” for certain existing
sources and certain air pollutants. Among other things, the statutory provision specifically
excludes from the Administrator’s authority the power to prescribe regulations relating to
“standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant . . . emitted from a source
category which is regulated under section 7412 of this title 1118., Section 112 of the CAA].” 42
U ,S.C. § 7411(d). EPA admits in its Legal Memorandum for the Proposed Rule that “a literal
reading of that language” means that “EPA c[an] not regulate any air pollutant from a source
category regulated under section 1 12” of the Clean Air Act. Mem. 26 (emphasis added); accord
70 Fed. Reg. at 16,032 (EPA reaching the same conclusion). Simply put, Section 1 11(d)’s plain
text provides that if an existing source category is regulated under Section 112, that source
category may not also be regulated under Section 1 11(d).

The regime codified in Sections 112 and 111 is part of a measured, coherent approach to
regulating air pollutants from new and existing pollution sources. Section 112 01‘ the Clean Air
Act concerns national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants (“HAPs”) emitted from
any number of new and existing sources. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412. Whether a source category is
regulated under Section 112 is generally dependent upon a number of factors. Id §7412(c).
With regard to coal-fired power plants, Congress specially provided that those sources need only
be regulated under Section 112 if the Administrator finds such regulation to be “appropriate and
necessary.” Id. § 7412(n). Section 111(d) in turn addresses the emission of air pollutants emitted
from existing sources not regulated under Section 112. Specifically, when EPA has chosen not
to regulate a source category nationally under Section 112, emissions from existing sources
within that category must be subject instead to state-by-state emission standards under Section
111(d), assuming certain other predicates have been satisfied. The rest of Section 11 l, which is
not at issue here, is not restricted by the scope of Section 112 and concerns national emissions
standards for air pollutants emitted from new sources.

In the present case, it is clear that EPA has no authority under Section 111(d) to regulate
“any” emission from coal—fired power plants, including C02 emissions. EPA categorized coal-
fired power plants as part of a “source category” under Section 112 in 2000, see 65 Fed. Reg.
79,825, 79,826 (Dec. 20, 2000), and the DC. Circuit in 2008 rejected EPA’s attempt to withdraw
that finding, see New Jersey in EPA, 517 F.3d 574 (DC. Cir. 2008). Then, in 2012, EPA
imposed significant Section 112 restrictions on coal-fired power plants. see 77 Fed. Reg. 9,304
(Feb. 16, 2012); 40 C.F.R. Part 63 subpart UUUUU, which the DC. Circuit recently upheld, see
also White Stallion Energy Cm, LLC v. EPA, 1‘ F.3d._, 2014 WL 1420294 (DC. Cir. Apr. 15.
2014). Under the “literal” reading of Section 111(d), Mom. 26, these rules regulating existing
coal-fired power plants under Section 112 prohibit EPA from invoking Section 111(d) to adopt
the Proposed Rule.

B. EPA’s Arguments Based Upon A Clerical “Drafting Error” In The 1990 Clean Air
Act Amendments Cannot Displace The “Literal” Terms Of Section 111(d)

Faced with the unambiguous terms of Section 1 11(d) in the US. Code, EPA falls back in
its Legal Memorandum to an erroneous prior analysis that the agency conducted in 2005, in

Page 292

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 4

which it concluded that Section 111(d) is actually “ambiguous" and therefore subject to the
agency’s “reasonable" interpretation. Mem. 8, 26, That 2005 analysis, which was part of a rule
under Section 111(d) that the DC. Circuit vacated in New Jersey v. EPA, 5i 7 F.3d 574—based
its conclusion entirely upon a clerical entry in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act that
was not codified in the US. Code but appears in the Statutes at Large. According to EPA, the
1990 Amendments included two entries relevant to Section 111(d). Both entries appear in the
Statutes at Large, but only the first amendment—described by EPA as the “substantive” one—w
was incorporated into the (5.8. Code. EPA argues that the mere existence of the second, clerical
amendment creates an ambiguity sufficient to call into doubt the language of Section 111(d) in
the US. Code. EPA’s attempt to displace the plain terms of Section 111(d) was wrong in 2005
and remains so today.

1. The Clerical “Drafting Error” In The 1990 CleanAir Act Amendments Does Not
Create An Ambiguity In The Terms Q/‘Section I 1 Md)

As a threshold matter, EPA’s analysis is wrong because the one-sentence clerical entry
referred to by EPA falls far short of the showing necessary to cast doubt on the plain terms of
Section 111(d) as they appear in the US. Code. The “Code of Laws of the United States current
at any time shall . , . establish prima facie the laws of the United States.” 1 U.S.C. § 204(a). As
“prima facie“ evidence, the language of Section 111(d) in the US Code is displaced only where
the US. Code is “inconsistent” with the Statutes at Large. See Stephan v. United States, 319
US. 423, 426 (1943). There is no inconsistency here.

A review of the two relevant entries in the Statutes at Large reveals that the clerical entry
does not create an ambiguity or inconsistency, but rather is—A-as even EPA has admitted—a
“drafting error [that] should not be considered.” 70 Fed, Reg. at 16,031.

The first relevant entry appears in the Statutes at Large among a list of other entries
making substantive amendments to Section ill. Prior to these amendments in 1990, Section
111(d) had prohibited EPA from requiring state—by-state regulation of any air pollutant on the list
of HAPs published under Section 112(b)(l)(A). This particular amendment made a significant
substantive change by replacing the reference to “112(b)(1)(A)” with the language that now
appears in the US. Code-“emitted from a source category which is regulated under section
llZ." Pub. L. No. 101-549, § 108(g), 104 Stat. 2399, 2467 (1990). As a result, the restriction in
Section 11 l(d) changed from one focused on HAPs regulated under Section H2 to one focused
instead on source categories regulated under that section.

The second relevant entry appears much later in the Statutes at Large among a list of
purely clerical changes — entitled “Conforming Amendments." Pub. L, No. 101-549, §302(a),
104 Stat, 2399, 2474 (1990). As explained in the Senate‘s Legislative Drafting Manual,
"Conforming Amendments” are “amendments of a provision of law that [are] necessitated by
the substantive amendments or provisions of the bill.” Senate Legislative Drafting Manual
§ l26(b)(2)(A). They effectuate the sorts of ministerial changes required to clean up a statute
after it has been substantively amended. Thus, conforming amendments “include[] amendments,

Page 293

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 5

such as amendments to the table of contents, that formerly may have been designated as clerical
amendments." Id

Consistent with its description as a conforming amendment, this particular entry sought
simply to bring up to date the cross-reference in Section 111(d) to Section 1 12(b)(1)(A). Other
amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990 had eliminated Section 112(b)(l)(A) entirely and
replaced it with Sections 112(b)(1), 112(b)(2), and 112(b)(3). This clerical amendment was
designed solely to account for those changes. Specifically, it provided that “Section 111(d)(1) of
the Clean Air Act is amended by striking ‘[l 12](b)(1)(A)’ and inserting in lieu thereof
‘[112](b).’” Pub. L. No. 101-549, § 302(3). Unlike the substantive amendment described above,
this non—substantive amendment would not have changed the restriction in Section 111(d) from
its pre-l990 focus on hazardous air pollutants regulated under Section 1 12.

In light of the substantive amendment, however, the second non-substantive amendment
was clearly an unnecessary mistake or, as EPA has put it, a “drafting error.” When the
conforming amendment is applied after the substantive amendment, as is required by the very
nature of conforming amendments, there is no clerical correction left to make because the cross—
reference to 112(b)(1)(A) has already been removed by the substantive amendment. This is
consistent with the codifier's notation in the US. Code that the clerical amendment "could not be
executed.” Revisor’s Note, 42 U.S.C. § 7411. Where a conforming amendment is entirely
unnecessary, it is rightly understood as a clerical mistake that need not be given any effect, See
Am, Petroleum Inst. v. SEC, 714 F.3d 1329, 1336-37 (DC. Cir. 2013).

EPA has correctly recognized as much—noting in 2005, for example, that the clerical
entry “is a drafting error and therefore should not be considered”~—but it then wrongly
determined that it nevertheless “must attempt to give effect to both the [substantive] and
[clerical] [entries], as they are both part of the current law." 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031; accord
Mem. 21 (recognizing “apparent drafting errors during enactment of the 1990 CAA
Amendments”). This fundamental ﬂaw dooms EPA’s analysis. As the DC. Circuit recently
explained, where a mistake in renumbering a statute and correcting a cross-reference conflicts
with substantive provisions of that statute, the mistake should be considered most likely “the
result of a scrivener’s errorﬂ“ and should not be treated as “creating an ambiguity." Am.
Petroleum, 714 F.3d at 1336-37. Under this reasoning, it is clear that the clerical entry simply
“should not be considered," as EPA originally concluded. 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031. At the very
minimum, the existence of such a non—substantive. “drafting error” is not enough to overcome
the fact that language codified in the U.S. Code is "prima facie” evidence of “the laws of the
United States.” 1 U.S.C. §204(a).

Put another way. EPA now asserts that the non-substantive and substantive
amendments—if each were implemented into Section 111(d)’s prior text standing alone—would
create two separate versions of Section 111(d), Mem. 24. The first version incorporates only the
non-substantive amendment and therefore retains the pro-1990 prohibition on regulating HAPS
under Section 111(d), regardless of whether the source category emitting those HAPs is
regulated under Section 112. The second version is the one that actually appears in the U.S.

Page 294

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
June 6, 2014
Page 6

Code and substantively changes the prohibition to forbidding EPA from regulating under Section
111(d) any air pollutants emitted by any existing source regulated under Section 112. Mem. 24.

But this approach of treating both amendments as, in effect, creating two different
version of 111(d) directly contradicts EPA’S concession that the inclusion of the non-substantive
entry in the Statutes at Large was merely a clerical “drafting error.” Critically, the only evidence
EPA may use in its attempt to rebut the terms of Section 111(d) as expressed in the U.8. Code is
the Statutes at Large, see Stephan, 319 US. at 426, and the Statutes at Large simply do not
re act two separate versions of Section 111(d). Rather. they reflect only two amendments~one
a substantive change and one a mere clerical entry—~and the clerical entry is rendered moot by
the substantive amendment.[3]

2. EPA ‘5' Policy Arguments Cream No Ambiguity In Section 111(d)

EPA’s policy arguments against the “literal” terms of Section lll(d) also cannot
generate an ambiguity where none exists in the plain statutory text. As a threshold matter, even
if EPA were correct that the “literal" terms of Section 111(d) produce overly harsh results for
EPA’S regulatory authority, EPA may not “redraft a statute in order to avoid what
the agency characterized as the ‘absurd results‘ that would ﬂow from the statute’s language”
where it is, as here, “‘not inconceivable that Congress meant what the statute says?” Ass'n of
Am. RRS. v. Surface Tramp. 8d, 162 F.3d 101, 105 (DC. Cir. 1998) (quoting Mova
Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Shalala. l40 F.3d 1060. 1072 (DC. Cir. 1998)). In any event, EPA’S
policy arguments miss the mark because the “literal” terms of Section 111(d) are part of a
rational regulatory scheme.

This regime quite logically avoids subjecting existing sources to both new national
standards for hazardous pollutants under Section 112 as well as new state-by—state standards
under Section 111, while permitting regulation under both Section 111 and Section 112 of new
sources. Unlike with new sources, the imposition of additional regulatory burdens on existing
sources raises questions of fairness and lost investments, as existing sources that were built under
a different regulatory regime may or may not have the technological or financial ability to come
into compliance with two sets of new rules. Indeed, both Sections 1 12 and l 1 1(d) recognize that
the cost of compliance must be weighed against maximum achievable reductions. See 42 U.S.C.

3 Although some had argued in 2005 and 2008 that the clerical entry should take precedence over the substantive
entry, EPA repeatedly and properly rejected those arguments as having “no merit.“ final Brief of Respondent EPA.
New Jersey v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574 (DC. Cir. 2008), 2007 W1, 2155494. at *103 n.33; accord 70 Fed. Reg. at 16,031-
32. For example, the agency has explained that the so-called “last in point of arrangement“ rule of statutory
construction "is inapplicable here, as it applies to discrete sections of the same Act, not competing amendments to
the same section of an Act, as is the case here.” 2007 W1, 2155494, at ‘5103 n.33. Indeed, EPA emphaticallv
declared that it is “hard to conceive“ that Congress would have intended to give effect to the clerical change over the
substantive change, because, among other things, only the substantive change gives meaning to Section
112(n)(l)(A), which was also adopted during the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act. Section 112(n)(l)(A)
required EPA to conduct a study to determine whether coal-fired power plants “should even be regulated under
section 1 12." 70 Fed. Reg. at 15,995. As EPA recognized, this provision is strong evidence that Congress did not
wish to subject such power plants to “duplicative or overlapping regulation." but rather sought to force EPA to
choose between regulating power plants as a source category under Section l12 or 111(d). consistent with the
substantive change and not the clerical one. Id. at 16,031.

Page 295

The Honorable Gina McCarthy

Page 7

§§ 7411(a)(1), 741 1(d), 7412(d). in establishing this regime, under which regulation of existing
sources occurs either under Section 112 or Section 111(d), Congress properly determined that
requiring the same existing source categories to comply with two functionally—independent
regulatory regimes would threaten these sources’ economic viability. Indeed, EPA has recently
imposed costly regulations on coal~fired power plants, which will cost those plants more than $9
billion dollars per year. See EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis for the final Mercury and Air
Toxics Standards at 3-13 (Dec. 2011), available at http://www.epa.gov/mt/ecas/regdata/RIAS
/matsriafinal.pdf‘, EPA’s Proposed Rule would subject those same plants to billions of dollars of
additional costs, through the imposition of duplicative regulatory requirements, forcing many of
those plants to close. That is the exact scenario Congress intended to avoid when it amended
Section 111(d).

in light of this understanding, EPA’s policy arguments in favor of ignoring Section
111(d)’s plain language are insubstantial.

EPA first claims that a “literal reading” of Section 111(d) would be contrary to
“Congress’ desire in the 1990 CAA Amendments to require EPA to regulate more substances.”
Mem. 25-26. But the mere fact that one of the broad purposes behind the 1990 Amendments
was to require EPA to regulate more substances under Section 112 does not mean that Congress
was not cognizant of other values, such as the need to avoid costly double regulation. In fact—
as EPA itself admitted in its 2005 analysis — the text, structure, and history of the 1990
Amendments indicates a desire by Congress to limit EPA’s ability to doubly regulate coal-fired
power plants, As explained above, the discussion and ultimate adoption of Section 112(n)(l)(A)
“reveals” that Congress did not want to subject coal—fired power plants to “duplicative or
otherwise inefficient regulation” 70 Fed. Reg. at 15,999. It is perfectly reasonable to understand
Section 111(d) as seeking to forward this same general goal of avoiding duplicative regulation.

EPA’s other policy argument is “the fact that the EPA has historically regulated non—
HAPs under section 111(d), even where those air pollutants were emitted from a source category
actually regulated under section 112.” Mem. 26. But it is no answer to the unambiguous textual
requirement in the 1990 Amendments to point to EPA‘s pre-amendment practice of regulating
non—l'lAPs under Section 111(0). EPA at one time enjoyed the power of regulating existing
source categories on separate regulatory tracks. See Mcm. 9-10 & n. 17. When Congress
amended the Clean Air Act in 1990 to require EPA to regulate more HAP’s under Section 112,
however, Congress sensibly paired that increased power with a textual limitation—embodied in
Section 111(d}—against using that enhanced authority to impose duplicative regulations on the
same existing source categories. EPA’s argument that the “literal" terms of Section 111(d)
would hamstring it from using a provision that it has only used to regulate “four pollutants from
live source categories” in “forty years," Mem. 9, cannot possibly provide a basis for disregarding
the literal terms of the Clean Air Act.

3. EPA's Attempt To Resolve The Supposed Ambiguity Is Nevertheless
Impermissible

Even if the clerical error created an ambiguity in Section lll(d)’s “literal” text, EPA’s
analysis would still fail. To begin with, the agency’s claim to some unidentified form of
“deference“ for its attempt to rewrite Section lll(d) is meritless. Mem. 12. Courts defer to
agencies under the test set forth in Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc, 467 U .S. 837 (1984), because there is reason to believe that when Congress “left ambiguity
in a statute,” it “understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the
agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion
the ambiguity allows." Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), NA, 517 U .S. 735, 740—741 (1996).
EPA could not possibly argue that Congress intended EPA to resolve the import of Congress’s
inadvertent clerical “drafting error.” Indeed, EPA does not so argue. EPA offers no justification
whatsoever for its bald assertion that it is entitled to deference on this issue, and does not even
cite to Chevron in its discussion of the issue.

In any event, EPA could not possibly prevail under Chevron—fir some other similar form
of deference—because it offers an “impermissible construction” of the supposedly ambiguous
statute. Aid Ass'n for Lutherans v. US. Postal Serra, 321 F.3d 1166, 1178 (DC. Cir. 2003).
EPA would interpret Section 111(d) as follows: "Where a source category is regulated under
section 112, a section 111(d) standard of performance cannot be established to address any HAPS
listed under section 112(1)) that may be entitled from that particular source category.” Mem. 26.
This is flatly inconsistent with the substantive provision, embodied in the US, Code, that EPA
may not “establish“ standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant . . .
emitted from a source category which is regulated under [Section 112 of the CAM.” 42
U.S.C. § 741 Md) (emphasis added). EPA’s proffered interpretation effectively replaces the term
“any air pollutant" with the term “hazardous air pollutant." Even under Chevron, an agency is
not entitled to deference when its interpretation is so “manifestly contrary to the statute.” Mayo
Found. for Med. Educ. & Research v. United States, 131 S. Ct. 704, 711 (2011) (internal
quotations omitted); accord Peril v. US. Dep’t of Educ., 675 F.3d 769, 785 (DC. Cir. 2012).

If EPA wanted to give effect to its view of both the substantive and the clerical entries in
the Statutes at Large—which, as explained above, EPA nonsensically claims create two versions
of Section 111(d}-without impermissibly changing the text of either, it could have done so. As
one commentator has explained, all of EPA’s textual concerns could be satisfied by interpreting
Section 111(d) to prohibit the regulation of “any air pollutant . . . which is not included on a list
published under .. .112(b) [revision of the prior version of Section lll(d) after inputting the
clerical entry] or emitted from a source category which is regulated under section 1 12 [revision
of the prior version of Section 111(d) after inputting the substantive entry].” William J. Haun,
The Clean Air Act as an Obstacle to the Environmental Protection Agency is Anticipated Attempt
to Regulate Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Power Plants, 14 Engage: J. Federalist
Soc’y Prac. Groups 35, 38 (Mar. 2013) (parentheticals revised). EPA does not — and could not——
dispute that this is the only interpretation that gives full effect and meaning to every word of both
“versions" of Section 111(d) that it believes the Statutes at Large embodies. Accordingly. to the
extent EPA continues to reject the position that the non-substantive entry must be discarded as an

Page 297

Page 9

inadvertent “scrivener‘s error[],” see Am. Petroleum, 714 F.3d at 1337, the agency is duty-bound
to adopt this alternative interpretation.

EPA’s refusal to advance or acknowledge this alternative is unsurprising, of course,
because under this approach the Proposed Rule would still be unlawful. Under this alternative
interpretation, EPA would be prohibited from using Section 111(d) both: (1) to require regulation
of any HAP listed in Section 112(b), regardless of whether the HAP is being emitted from a
source regulated under Section 112; and (2) to require regulation of (my pollutant emitted from a
source category that is regulated under Section 112, Even under this alternative reading, EPA
still cannot rely on Section 111(d) as a basis for the Proposed Rule because of the regulatory
scheme established under Section 112.[4]

EPA has fundamentally erred in relying upon the ﬂawed reasoning in the vacated 2005
rule to justify the Proposed Rule. It is simply unconscionable for EPA to go forward with this
massive and costly regulation based entirely upon what it has admitted to be a clerical “drafting
error." I urge you to withdraw the Proposed Rule immediately and avoid needless litigation.

Sincerely,

Coal Country's Decline Has a Long History

<See original Document for Chart: Number of coal jobs by state (1983-2012)>



By Patrick Reis

Follow on Twitter

Sen. Rand Paul sees a "depression“ in Appalachia's coal country, and he says there‘s one man to blame for it: President Obama.

The Kentucky Republican isn‘t alone in his fury over Obama's treatment of the coal industry. A bipartisan bloc of elected officials
from across the region shares his views, including two influential West Virginia Democrats, Sen. Joe Manchin and Rep. Nick Rahall. The critics argue that by tightening rules on mountaintop-removal coal mining and imposing greenhouse-gas emission
limits on coal-fired power plants, Obama and his allies are regulating the industry out of business—and putting legions of coal
miners out of work.

The president‘s regulatory push has left him and his party deeply unpopular across the region: Bill Clinton won Kentucky and
West Virginia in both of his presidential elections; Obama lost both states, twice in landslides.

But for all the rage over Obama‘s environmental agenda, mining jobs began disappearing in the region long before he entered
the White House, for reasons that have nothing to do with regulations now coming out of Washington,


Page 299

6/18/2014 Coal Countrys Decline Has a Long History~ NationalJournal.com

In fact, coal mining jobs in Appalachia fared far worse under the Reagan, Clinton, and George H.W. Bush administrations than they have under Obama.

According to employment counts from the Mine Safety and Health Administration, from 1983—the earliest year for which MSHA had data — to 1989, combined coal jobs in West Virginia and Kentucky fell from 79,000 to 64,000.

In the following four years under the first President Bush. coal jobs in the two states fell to 56,000. And by the final year of the Clinton administration, the states' combined total of mining jobs had fallen to a nadir of 33,000.

By comparison, West Virginia and Kentucky coal-mining payrolls have been relatively stable during Obama's first four years in office: in 2009. there were just under 43,000 coal miners in the two states combined. in 2012, the latest year for which MSHA has final data. the count totaled just over 41,000.

So what's driving the decline? First and foremost: changes in the industry.

Despite mining employment being out nearly in half since 1983, the two states‘ combined coal cutout has basically held steady, dropping from 245 million short tons in 1983 to 240 million short tons in 2011.

Advances in mining technology have made miners more efficient.

Indeed, the traditional images of coal mines-dark holes filled with men swinging pickaxes and pushing carts—are no more.
Today, it is machines that are ripping coal from the mines' walls, and then automatic conveyor belts whipping the fuel back to the surface.

And much of the production has moved above ground entirely. thanks to a practice known as mountaintop—removal mining, in
which miners use controlled explosions to open mountains and mine the newly exposed coal seams.

For the miners and other industry employees who still hold jobs, the increased productivity has paid off. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nominal average annual coal industry employee wages in West Virginia sat at $54,000. By 2012, the average employee was taking home nearly $85,000.

The starring role of mechanization, however, does not mean that federal policies have no effect on the number of coal jobs.

The region saw its fortunes reverse under President George W. Bush. who in 2002 relaxed rules on mountaintop-removal mining
to give companies more leeway to dump their leftovers into the region’s waterways. From 2001 to 2008. West Virginia and
Kentucky's combined coal industry experienced a mini-revival. adding an average of about 1.000 mining jobs per year.

But as industry officials argue they could experience another such revival. they face a new hurdle that had not yet fully taken of in the early 2000s Today, they face stiffer competition from natural gas. which is both more abundant and less expensive due to the fracking boom.

Honorable Barack Obama
President of the United States
The White House

Washington. DC 20500

Dear Mr. President:

As Governors leading diverse States that both produce and consume energy. we ask that you pursue a
pragmatic energy policy that balances our nation’s economic needs, energy security, and environmental
quality objectives.

As you know, the energy industry is a major source of job creation in our country. providing employment
to millions of our citizens and bolstering U.S. economic competitiveness. America was able to meet
almost 90 percent of its energy needs last year—the most since March l985—in large part because of
increased domestic energy production. We take pride in the fact that domestic production largely powers
America and increasingly other economics as well, helping to eradicate poverty and to provide political
stability around the globe.

Development of our resources has put more money in the pockets of working families and has helped the
poor and elderly on fixed incomes, who can now more easily afford to run their air conditioning in the
heat of the summer. For example. American natural gas production is reducing average retail electricity
prices by 10 percent, saving households, on average, nearly $1,000 per year between 2012 and 2015.

This significant accomplishment of increased U.S. energy independence, with its associated economic
and health benefits. has been achieved largely by State policies—despite redundant and burdensome

Federal regulation. Your proposed rules for regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from existing
power plants and redefining the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) would unnecessarily expand
federal authority over the States in energy policymaking and risk undermining our success.

In an unprecedented move, your GHG emissions plan would largely dictate to the States the type of
electricity generation they could build and operate. In addition, you seek to essentially ban coal from the
U.S. energy mix. Your pursuit of this objective will heavily impact those of our states that rely primarily
on coal for electricity generation—such a decision should not be made by unaccountable bureaucrats.
Your Administration is also pushing for Washington to seize regulatory control of nearly all waters
located in the States by expanding the definition of WOTUS. If successful, the federal government would
become the arbiters of how our citizens, State highway departments, county ﬂood control and storm water
agencies, utilities, irrigation districts, and farmers use their water and their land.

Although we are still examining the impacts of the GHG proposal released on June 2 and the proposed
expansion of WOTUS, we can confidently say that, according to the best available data, millions of jobs
will be lost and billions of dollars will be spent over the coming decades in an effort to comply with these
and other federal regulations. And those numbers stand to increase with every tightening of those
standards — hitting particularly hard working families, poor, and elderly.

Perhaps most disturbing is the fact that your Administration is content to force Americans to bear these
substantial costs where there are highly questionable associated environmental benefits. In fact. your
EPA Administrator admitted during testimony to the U.S. Senate that there would be no climate
mitigation benefits to America pursuing unilateral action. Moreover, in 2008. you personally guaranteed
that under your energy plan, “electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.“ You admitted that your
energy plan would have the following impact: "[Energy industries] would have to retrofit their
operations—that will cost money. They will pass that money onto consumers."

You rightly acknowledge that American citizens will literally pay the price of your energy agenda. They
will also pay the price in the form of lost jobs and less reliable electricity. As representatives of the
citizens who stand to lose so much while gaining next to nothing, it is our duty to confront this issue and
to ask that you rescind the regulations you have put forth. Disposing of these regulations will protect
Americans from the costs and burdens the rules would impose upon them and will ensure the continuation
of America‘s energy renaissance, which is indispensable to our country‘s economic recovery and job
creation and which is largely a result of State policies.

Sincerely,

Governor Sean Parnell 	Governor Mike Pence 	Governor Bobby Jindal
